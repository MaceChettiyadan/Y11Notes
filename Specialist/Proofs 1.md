#### Introduction
- Proofs demonstrate the absolute truth of a statement, and should aim to achieve three things
	- Correctness
	- Clarity
	- Simplicity
- In proving statements, we should know some basic algebraic representations
	- `Even numbers - ` *$2m$ for some $m \in \mathbb{Z}$*
	- `Odd numbers` - *$2m + 1$ for some $m \in \mathbb{Z}$*
	- `Divisible by `$a$ -  *$am$ for some $m \in \mathbb{Z}$*
	- `Perfect Square` - *There exists* $a^2$ *for some* $a \in \mathbb{Z}$
	- `Prime` - *There does not exist* $ab$ *for some* $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ *and* $a,b>1$
- There are different ways to prove a statement, these are discussed below 

#### Direct Proof
##### Reasoning
- Direct proofs are in response to conditional statements, for example
	- `If it is raining, then the grass is wet`
	- In the form `If P is true, then Q is true`
	- This is mathematically represented $P \implies Q$ (`P` implies `Q`)
		- `P` is the hypothesis, and `Q` is the conclusion
- Not all conditional statements are true.

##### The Proof
- To give a **direct** proof of a statement $P \implies Q$, we must assume the hypothesis (P) to be true and show the conclusion (Q)
- **Example**
	- `If a is odd and b is even, then a + b is odd`
	- $let \space a = 2n+1 \space for \space some \space n \in \mathbb{Z}$ (we must include for some)
	- $let \space b=2m \space for \space some \space b \in \mathbb{Z}$ (second definition)
	- $a+b=2n+1+2m$
	- $=2(n+m)+1$; this is in the odd form ([[#Introduction]]) - we must complete that however by stating $for \space some \space n+m \in \mathbb{Z}$
	- $\therefore Q.E.D$; from above it is obviously proved, but we should wrap it up - **Q.E.D essentially means** *it is proved, as you can obviously see*
- There may be more complex examples
	- These will require **factorisation** and algebraic manipulation, and expanded reasoning
	- The logic stays the same though
	- **Knights and Knaves** questions will almost always require the consideration of *all cases*

#### Proof by Contrapositive
##### Reasoning
- Sometimes it is difficult to prove $P \implies Q$ through direct proof; consider
	- `If ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is even then ` $n$ `is odd`  
	- We can't assume `P` ($n^{2}+2n+1$) because it is difficult to define
	- However we can use the contrapositive
- **The contrapositive of** $P \implies Q$ is $Q' \implies P'$ (the **negated things in the opposite order**

###### Negation
- Making something opposite is called **negation** - the negation of $1+1=2$ is $1+1 \not = 2$
	- We can, however, encounter more difficult negations.
	- Consider `negation of (6 is divisible by 2 and 3)`
	- We can use De morgan's laws for this
		- `not (P and Q) is the same as (not P) or (not Q)`
		- `not (P or Q) is the same as (not P) and (not Q)`
	- Therefore the above becomes `6 is not divisible by 2 or 6 is not divisible by 3`

###### Using Negation for the Contrapositive
- For the above, `If ` $n$ `is even then ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is odd`
- **If the original P => Q is true, it's contrapositive will always be true, and vice versa**
	- The above is therefore true and can be directly proved 

##### Proof
- Let us consider the above; `If ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is even then ` $n$ `is odd` 
	- First, we should negate both sides and flip them - writing the contrapositive
	- This is `If ` $n$ `is even then ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is odd` in the form $P \implies Q$
	- $let \space n = 2a \space for \space some \space a \in \mathbb{Z}$
	- $n^{2}+2n+1 = (2a)^{2}+2(2a)+1$
	- $=4a^2+4a+1$; getting us into even number accounted form
	- $=2(a^{2}+2a)+1$; it may seem like we are doing little but this puts us in the traditional odd form
		- $for \space some  \space a^{2}+2a \in \mathbb{Z}$
	- $\therefore Q.E.D$

#### Equivalence Proofs
##### Reasoning
- Equivalent Statements are given in the form $P \iff Q$
	- To prove equivalence though, we must first prove a statement **and** [[#The converse]]
- In written form, $P \iff Q$ is `P is true if and only if Q is true`, for example;
	- `Your heart is beating if and only if you are alive` (this is an equivalent statement)
- If a question includes `if and only if`, remember to consider both cases
	- To indicate the case being proven, write $\implies$ or $\impliedby$

##### The converse
- If a statement $P \implies Q$ exists, then the converse is simply $Q \implies P$
	- i.e the contrapositive with less steps

#### Disproving of Statements
##### Reasoning
- In general, when **disproving** statements, we only need **one example**
- There are, however, two types of statements you may have to disprove;
	- **Universal Quantification** (also known as *for all*).
		- `For all natural numbers n, 2n > n + 1`
		- The above statement can only be **proved** by providing an argument concerning all natural numbers *n*
	- **Existential Quantification** (also known as *there exists*)
		- `There exists an integer m such that m^2 = 25`
		- Due to the nature of this statement, we only need one integer *m* to **prove** the statement
	- Both of these statements involve quantifiers. In order to disprove, we should know [[#Negating Quantifiers]]

##### Negating Quantifiers
- To negate quantifiers, we just swap 'there exists' and 'for all' and then *negate the rest of the statement*
	- `For all natural numbers n, 2n > n+1` $\rightarrow$ `There exists natural number n such that 2n < n + 1`
	- And vice versa.

##### Disproving
- **Universal Quantifications**
	- Can be disproved via `counterexample` - this is because it asserts truth without exception.
- **Existential Quantification**
	- This is different - because this involves a *there exists* (truth with exceptions), we must prove that there does not exist at all
		- Due to this, we must prove **the negation to be true** ([[#Negating Quantifiers]])
