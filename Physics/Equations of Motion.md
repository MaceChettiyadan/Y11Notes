#### Graphs
- The main equations can be related to graphs.
- When **given a graph**, look at the axis and determine the things being measured, i.e velocity with respect to time.
- The gradients of graphs are useful at determining average/values at a point in time
	- **Area under the curve** is like the other way. i.e area under curve of acceleration = velocity.
- Average vs instantaneous velocity
	- Average over curve
	- Instantaneous - use tangents.

#### Equations
- $V=\frac{s}{t}$; however, this is average, so you should write $V_{av}= \frac{s}{t}$
- $v=u+at$
- $s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$
- $v^2=u^2+2as$
- Where,

| Measure           | Symbol |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| Displacement      | $s$    |
| Intitial Velocity | $u$    |
| Final Velocity    | $v$    |
| Acceleration      | $a$    |
| Time              | $t$       |
