- That which causes an object of mass to change in its motion (it changes its velocity), if it is not balanced.
	- A pull is basically a push in the opposite direction
	- Can be categorised;

|      | Contact               | Non-Contact |
| ---- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| Push | Shove, Kick, Punch    | Magnetism, Same Poles            |
| Pull | Grab, Hug, Tug of War | Magnetism, Opposite Poles, Gravity             |

##### 3 Laws
1. An object of mass will continue in its state of motion unless acted upon by an unbalenced force. Motion = velocity.
2. Basically $f=ma$. The acceleration of an object of mass is proportional to the unbalanced force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass
3. Every action force has an equal and opposite reaction force.
