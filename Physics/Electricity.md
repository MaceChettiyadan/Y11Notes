### Static Electricity
- 3 charge states
	- **Positive**, **Neutral**, **Negative**
	- Positive and Negative are the two types of charge: $+ve$ and $-ve$
	- Neutral - neutrinos, antineutrinos, neutrons i.e. fundamental particles that have no charge
		- atoms by definition are an uncharged species
- Charge, like mass is a property of matter
	- An object of charge possesses an **electric field** around it which:
		- extends to *infinity*
		- results in other objects of charge experiencing an electric force when placed in the field
		- has an electric field which decreases with distance from the object
		- this force may be attraction to propulsion
