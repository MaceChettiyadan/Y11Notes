### Static Electricity
- 3 charge states
	- **Positive**, **Neutral**, **Negative**
	- Positive and Negative are the two types of charge: $+ve$ and $-ve$
	- Neutral - neutrinos, antineutrinos, neutrons i.e. fundamental particles that have no charge
		- atoms by definition are an uncharged species
- Charge, like mass is a property of matter
	- An object of charge possesses an **electric field** around it which:
		- extends to *infinity*
		- results in other objects of charge experiencing an electric force when placed in the field
		- has an electric field which decreases with distance from the object
		- this force may be <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">attraction</mark> or <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">propulsion</mark> 
- If electrons are redistributed on an object to produce regions of different charge i.e. an electric dipole, then this is charging by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">induction</mark>. - the separation of charge is temporary and will reverse once the inducing charge is removed
	- If electrons are physically transferred then the loss/gain of charge is not temporary - this is charging by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">conduction</mark>

### Electric Field Diagram
- It is assumed that charge is uniformly distributed around a charged object
- Field lines are evenly distributed around objection
- minimum of four field lines
	- Must be an arrow going the right direction
