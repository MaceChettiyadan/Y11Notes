### Static Electricity
- 3 charge states
	- **Positive**, **Neutral**, **Negative**
	- Positive and Negative are the two types of charge: $+ve$ and $-ve$
	- Neutral - neutrinos, antineutrinos, neutrons i.e. fundamental particles that have no charge
		- atoms by definition are an uncharged species
- Charge, like mass is a property of matter
	- An object of charge possesses an **electric field** around it which:
		- extends to *infinity*
		- results in other objects of charge experiencing an electric force when placed in the field
		- has an electric field which decreases with distance from the object
		- this force may be <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">attraction</mark> or <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">propulsion</mark> 
- If electrons are redistributed on an object to produce regions of different charge i.e. an electric dipole, then this is charging by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">induction</mark>. - the separation of charge is temporary and will reverse once the inducing charge is removed
	- If electrons are physically transferred then the loss/gain of charge is not temporary - this is charging by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">conduction</mark>

### Electric Field Diagram
- It is assumed that charge is uniformly distributed around a charged object
- Field lines are evenly distributed around objection
- minimum of four field lines
	- Must be an arrow going the right direction

### Coulomb's Law
- $Fe$ - the force of an electric field
	- It decreases inversely proportional to the square of the distance
- $$Fe=\frac{k \space q_{1}q_2}{r^2}$$
	- $k$ is the constant of proportionality - $9.00\times10^9$
	- $q_{1}...$ are the two charged objects (in $c$ - Coulombs , which measure charge)
	- $r (d)$ is the distance between the two objects 
- Two point charges of $7.4mC$ and $6.4mC$ are $65.4cm$ apart. What is the force acting between them.
	- it is $1.00N$
$24.6=\frac{x}{5.8081}$


### Electric Circuits
- Current is a flow of at least one electron
- **Conventional Current** is the flow of $+ve$ charge, i.e. current
- **E circuits** transform electrical energy into other forms of useful energy - thermal, electromagnetic/photonic

### Minimum components for a circuit
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Power pack</mark> i.e. source of energy/potential difference e.g. battery
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Wire</mark> - conducting material made of a conductor
	- Devices/component/resistors

### Potential Difference
- When charge moves from one position to another, work is done on the change i.e. they have changed in their electric potential energy
	- $W=\Delta E$
	- $V=\frac{W}{q}$
	- $V=$ potential difference/voltage ($V$)
	- $W=$ work done (change in $Ep$) ($J$)
	- $q=$ charge ($C$)

### Current
- The amount of charge which flows past a given point in a given unit of time
	- $I=\frac{q}{\Delta t}$
	- $I=$ current in amperes ($A$)
	- $q=$ charge ($C$)
	- $\Delta t=$ time interval ($s$)
- 3.01c 4.05m = 243s
- $I=3.01/243$


## The PRAC!
### Series
- **Current** is the **same** in every part of a **series** circuit
- If more components (that is, resistors) are added, the effective current is reduced, but will still be the same everywhere
	- $I_{tot}=I_1=I_2=I_3$
	- $V=IR$
- For a single component in series with the energy source, $V=emf$
- If **more components are added** in series then the **sum of their individual drops** in voltage **add up to the sum of the voltage drops** across all of them
	- $V_{tot}=V_1+V_2+V_3$
### Parallel
- Current is divided among components in different branches
	- $I_{tot}=I_1+I_2+I_3$
- Voltage is the same in each branch
	- $V_{tot}=V_1=V_2=V_3$


## Ohm's law and resistance
- **Resistance** is the measure of the difficulty with which charge moves through a medium ($\Omega$)
	- $V=IR$ such that $R=\frac{V}{I}$
- Ohmic vs non-ohmic devices
	- y-axis is I (amps) and x is volts (V)
	- when the line is not linear it is non-ohmic

### Series
- Since total current is always equal,
- and total voltage is the sum of individuals,
- and $V=IR$,
	- $Re=R_1+R_2+R_3$

### Parallel
- since total voltage is the same
- and total current is the sum of individuals,
- and $V=IR$,
	- $\frac{1}{Re}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}$


### Electrical Safety
- Bird on power line - bird has more resistance than line, so current won't go through it
	- if it stands over both lines, then the circuit is completed by the bird (short-circuited), it is shocked
- **Fuses**
	- some houses have fuses
	- Residual current devices - **RCD** - monitor current in active vs natural lines - might be different
	- **Insulator** - most devices have an insulation coating
