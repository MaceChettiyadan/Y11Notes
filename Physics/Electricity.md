### Static Electricity
- 3 charge states
	- **Positive**, **Neutral**, **Negative**
	- Positive and Negative are the two types of charge: $+ve$ and $-ve$
	- Neutral - neutrinos, antineutrinos, neutrons i.e. fundamental particles that have no charge
		- atoms by definition are an uncharged species
- Charge, like mass is a property of matter
	- An object of charge possesses an **electric field** around it which:
		- extends to *infinity*
		- results in other objects of charge experiencing an electric force when placed in the field
		- has an electric field which decreases with distance from the object
		- this force may be <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">attraction</mark> or <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">propulsion</mark> 
- If electrons are redistributed on an object to produce regions of different charge i.e. an electric dipole, then this is charging by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">induction</mark>. - the separation of charge is temporary and will reverse once the inducing charge is removed
	- If electrons are physically transferred then the loss/gain of charge is not temporary - this is charging by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">conduction</mark>

### Electric Field Diagram
- It is assumed that charge is uniformly distributed around a charged object
- Field lines are evenly distributed around objection
- minimum of four field lines
	- Must be an arrow going the right direction

### Coulomb's Law
- $Fe$ - the force of an electric field
	- It decreases inversely proportional to the square of the distance
- $$Fe=\frac{k \space q_{1}q_2}{r^2}$$
	- $k$ is the constant of proportionality - $9.00\times10^9$
	- $q_{1}...$ are the two charged objects (in $c$ - Coulombs , which measure charge)
	- $r (d)$ is the distance between the two objects 
- Two point charges of $7.4mC$ and $6.4mC$ are $65.4cm$ apart. What is the force acting between them.
	- it is $1.00N$
