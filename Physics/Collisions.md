- Two classifications - [[#Elastic]] and [[#Inelastic]]

#### Elastic
- Total Kinetic Energy ($TKE$) of an object in motion is conserved
#### Inelastic
- Total Kinetic Energy ($TKE$) of an object in motion is not conserved
	- Some of it is transformed into other types of energy e.g heat, sound and light

#### Example Questions
- A bear of $24.2kg$ is travelling east at $6.66m\space s^{-1}$ when it collides with something sticky and disgusting which has mass $8.47kg$ and is travelling west at $7.77m\space s^{-1}$. They coalesce to form a sticky, disgusting bear mass thing (sdbmt).
	- What is the final velocity of the sdbmt?
		- $6.95m s^{-1}$
	- Show by calculation whether the collision was elastic or inelastic. Justify your answer.
		- It is inelastic. To prove, $TKE_{1} \not= TKE_2$
		- $TKE_1=\frac{1}{2}24.2\times 6.66^2=536$ 
		- $TKE_2=\frac{1}{2}8.47 \times (-7.77)^2$
