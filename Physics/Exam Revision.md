## Linear Motion
##### Distinguish between scalar and vector quantities, and add and subtract vectors in one dimension
- Scalar quantities have a magnitude, Vectors have both direction and magnitude
	- Scalar - distance, e.g. $4.57m$
	- Vector - displacement, e.g. $4.57m \space South$
- Adding and subtracting is as it is in maths.
	- Subtract the negative e.g. *What is the change in velocity of Bongleshnout's Scooter as he turns a corner if he approaches it at $18.7ms^{-1}$ west and exits it at $16.6ms^{-1}$ north?
		- Remember: $\Delta v=v_{f}-v_{i}=v_f+(-v_i)$
		- As such, this would be $16.6ms^{-1}$ north + $18.7ms^{-1}$ east
		- Work from there.

##### Uniformly accelerated motion is described in terms of relationships between measurable scalar and vector quantities, including displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration â€”this includes applying SUVAT
- The quantities:
	- Displacement is a vector $m$
	- Speed is a scalar $m \space s ^{-1}$
	- Velocity is a vector $m \space s ^{-1}$
	- Acceleration is a vector $m \space s ^{-2}$
- Remember, simultaneous may have to be done between the SUVATs
- The value $a$ for gravity is $9.8m \space s^{-2}$
##### Representations, including graphs, vectors, and equations of motion, can be used qualitatively and quantitatively to describe and predict linear motion
- N.B. m/s to km/h is multiplication by 3.6, and vice versa.

###### Graphs
- **Velocity-Time**
	- Derivative is acceleration
	- Integral is displacement
- **Acceleration-Time**
	- Derivative is ***JERK*
	- Integral is change in velocity

###### Equations
- When considering *maximum height* problems, there will exist a velocity $0$
- On inclined planes, use the equation $g \space \sin(\theta)$
	- Remember, mass has no impact on acceleration (though it does on friction, but on inclined plane questions friction is usually discounted)
