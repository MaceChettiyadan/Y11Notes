## Linear Motion
##### Distinguish between scalar and vector quantities, and add and subtract vectors in one dimension
- Scalar quantities have a magnitude, Vectors have both direction and magnitude
	- Scalar - distance, e.g. $4.57m$
	- Vector - displacement, e.g. $4.57m \space South$
- Adding and subtracting is as it is in maths.
	- Subtract the negative e.g. *What is the change in velocity of Bongleshnout's Scooter as he turns a corner if he approaches it at $18.7ms^{-1}$ west and exits it at $16.6ms^{-1}$ north?
		- Remember: $\Delta v=v_{f}-v_{i}=v_f+(-v_i)$
		- As such, this would be $16.6ms^{-1}$ north + $18.7ms^{-1}$ east
		- Work from there.

##### Uniformly accelerated motion is described in terms of relationships between measurable scalar and vector quantities, including displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration —this includes applying SUVAT
- The quantities:
	- Displacement is a **vector** $m$
	- Speed is a scalar $m \space s ^{-1}$
	- Velocity is a **vector** $m \space s ^{-1}$
	- Acceleration is a **vector** $m \space s ^{-2}$
- Remember, simultaneous may have to be done between the SUVATs

##### Representations, including graphs, vectors, and equations of motion, can be used qualitatively and quantitatively to describe and predict linear motion
- N.B. m/s to km/h is multiplication by 3.6, and vice versa.

###### Graphs
- **Velocity-Time**
	- Derivative is acceleration
	- Integral is displacement
- **Acceleration-Time**
	- Derivative is ***JERK*
	- Integral is change in velocity

###### Equations
- When considering *maximum height* problems, there will exist a velocity $0$
- On inclined planes, use the equation $g \space \sin(\theta)$
	- Remember, mass has no impact on acceleration (though it does on friction, but on inclined plane questions friction is usually discounted)

##### Vertical motion is analysed by assuming the acceleration due to gravity is constant near Earth’s surface
- The value $a$ for gravity is $9.8m \space s^{-2}$

##### Newton’s three Laws of Motion describe the relationship between the force or forces acting on an object, modelled as a point mass, and the motion of the object due to the application of the force or forces
- Force ($F$) is measured in $N$; it is a **vector quantity**
- Laws
	1. An object will maintain constant velocity unless an unbalanced, external force acts on it - informally, 'no force, no acceleration'
		- *Inertia* is considered to be the resistance to a change in motion of an object.
		- It is directly related to momentum.
		- Due to inertia, an object will continue with its motion unless a net force acts on the object.
	2. $F=ma$
		- i.e. 'The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force on the object and inversely proportional to the mass of the object'
		- $F=ma, \space \therefore F=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$
	3. For every action (force), there is an equal and opposite reaction (force).


##### Free body diagrams show the forces and net force acting on objects, from descriptions of real-life situations involving forces acting in one or two dimensions
- This is an experience thing, just know how to do it.

##### Momentum is a property of moving objects; it is conserved in a closed system and may be transferred from one object to another when a force acts over a time interval
- Momentum is conserved in a closed system and a property of moving objects. It is a **vector quantity**
- $p=mv$
	- mass x velocity
	- measured by $kg \space m\space s^{-1}$
- Momentum is *conserved in interactions between objects* and thus  $\sum\limits P$ before = $\sum\limits P$ after.
	- Since it involves many vectors, to get direction easily, assign a negative and a positive.
- *Change in* momentum is **impulse**
	- $=mv-mu=m(v-u)=m\Delta v$
	- Unit is $N s$ (Newton-Seconds) and is a **vector 

##### Energy is conserved in isolated systems and is transferred from one object to another when a force is applied over a distance; this causes work to be done and changes the kinetic (Ek) and/or potential (Ep) energy of objects
- Energy is the capacity to cause a change
- **Kinetic** and **Potential** energy are both types of **Mechanical** energy, measures in **Joules** as a **Scalar**
	- Any moving object has kinetic energy. 
		- $=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$
	- Potential energy is the energy of objects relative to one another or in fields.
		- Gravitational potential Energy (GPE) is $mgh$
- **Work** is the transferring or transforming of energy on an object.
	- $W=Fs$ or $W=Fs\cos \theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle between $F$ and $s$
		- or $=\frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{1}{2}mu^2$
	- It is measured in **Joules** as a **Scalar**
	- If a force is applied on an object but it does not move ($s=0$), then no work is done on it.
	- On a **force-displacement** graph, **work** is the integral.
- **Total Mechanical Energy** is the sum of kinetic and GPE energies

##### Collisions may be elastic and inelastic; kinetic energy is conserved in elastic collisions
- Literally what the objective says.
- 

#### Car Crashes
##### Seatbelts
- Due to Newton's first law, if a car suddenly decelerates, then the occupants will stay in motion, flying out the window or hitting it (bad). Seatbelts oppose the inertia of occupants' bodies.

##### Airbag
- As the occupants move forward due to inertia, airbags increase the time that the force is applied. Due to this, impulse is drawn out over a greater period of time and force is minimized.

##### Crumple zones, helmets and safety barriers
- Same as airbags. Increase time, decreasing force.
