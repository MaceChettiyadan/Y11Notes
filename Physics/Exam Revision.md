## Linear Motion
##### Distinguish between scalar and vector quantities, and add and subtract vectors in one dimension
- Scalar quantities have a magnitude, Vectors have both direction and magnitude
	- Scalar - distance, e.g. $4.57m$
	- Vector - displacement, e.g. $4.57m \space South$
- Adding and subtracting is as it is in maths.
	- Subtract the negative e.g. *What is the change in velocity of Bongleshnout's Scooter as he turns a corner if he approaches it at $18.7ms^{-1}$ west and exits it at $16.6ms^{-1}$ north?
		- Remember: $\Delta v=v_{f}-v_{i}=v_f+(-v_i)$
		- As such, this would be $16.6ms^{-1}$ north + $18.7ms^{-1}$ east
		- Work from there.

##### Uniformly accelerated motion is described in terms of relationships between measurable scalar and vector quantities, including displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration —this includes applying SUVAT
- The quantities:
	- Displacement is a **vector** $m$
	- Speed is a scalar $m \space s ^{-1}$
	- Velocity is a **vector** $m \space s ^{-1}$
	- Acceleration is a **vector** $m \space s ^{-2}$
- Remember, simultaneous may have to be done between the SUVATs

##### Representations, including graphs, vectors, and equations of motion, can be used qualitatively and quantitatively to describe and predict linear motion
- N.B. m/s to km/h is multiplication by 3.6, and vice versa.

###### Graphs
- **Velocity-Time**
	- Derivative is acceleration
	- Integral is displacement
- **Acceleration-Time**
	- Derivative is ***JERK*
	- Integral is change in velocity

###### Equations
- When considering *maximum height* problems, there will exist a velocity $0$
- On inclined planes, use the equation $g \space \sin(\theta)$
	- Remember, mass has no impact on acceleration (though it does on friction, but on inclined plane questions friction is usually discounted)

##### Vertical motion is analysed by assuming the acceleration due to gravity is constant near Earth’s surface
- The value $a$ for gravity is $9.8m \space s^{-2}$

##### Newton’s three Laws of Motion describe the relationship between the force or forces acting on an object, modelled as a point mass, and the motion of the object due to the application of the force or forces

##### Free body diagrams show the forces and net force acting on objects, from descriptions of real-life situations involving forces acting in one or two dimensions

##### Momentum is a property of moving objects; it is conserved in a closed system and may be transferred from one object to another when a force acts over a time interval
- Momentum is conserved in a closed system and a property of moving objects. It is a **vector**
- $p=mv$
	- mass x velocity
	- measured by $kg \space m\space s^{-1}$
- Momentum is *conserved in interactions between objects* and thus  $\sum\limits P$ before = $\sum\limits P$ after.



## Questions
(from pearson)
1. Determine the resultant force when forces of $5.0N$ east and $3.0N$ north act on a tree.
2. Determine the change in velocity of a ball as it bounces off a wall. The ball approaches at $7.0m\space s^{-1}$ south and rebounds at $6.0m \space s^{-1}$ east. Make sure to include an appropriate vector diagram.
3. Bob is applying a force of $15.0N$ to a sled on a frictionless surface, using a handle that is angled $50\degree$ to the ground. The sled weighs $7.45kg$. What is its acceleration?
