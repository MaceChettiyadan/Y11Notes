# Waves
- Are the ***transfer of energy*** from one place to another without the *net* displacement of matter.
	- **Mechanical Waves** have an absolute requirement for a medium e.g. Sound cannot propogate through a vacuum
	- **Non-Mechanical Waves (EMR)** - does not require a medium, can propogate through a vacuum but can also propogate through other media - e.g light
- The **direction** of displacement of particles in the media
	- *Transverse* waves - perpendicular to the direction of propogation
	- *Longitudinal* waves - parallel to the direction of propogation

- Below, Amplitude (A) is the max displacement of a particle in the medium from the mean/ medium position (x-axis). For a displacement-distance graph, the time between two consecutive *in phase* points gives the wavelength of the wave. Period (T) is the time it takes for a single wave to pass a given point. Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive in-phase points.
- *Frequency* cannot be directly gotten from a wave graph $\downarrow$, $T=\dfrac{1}{f}$
	- ****FREQUENCY*** is a fundamental property of the wave that **CANNOT** change.
- $V=\lambda f=\dfrac{\lambda}{T}$ where $V$ is speed in $m\space s^{-1}$, $\lambda$ is wavelength in metres, and $T$ is period in seconds, and $f$ is the frequency in $s^{-1}, Hz$

## Wave Behaviours
#### Reflection
- **Reflection** - when energy is incident upon a surface, or a boundry between two different media, then some/all of the energy rebounds back into the original medium.
- Wavelength and speed will remain constant if there is a reflection. Frequency is always constant
- The ***law of reflection*** states that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence.

##### Echoes
- The **reflection** of *sound* from a hard surface.
- How long before hearing sound/how long before it hits the wall are the questions that will be asked
	- Need to consider speed of sound in air at $25\degree$ as $346m s^{-1}$ (its on the data sheet)
	-  Knowing the distance from the wall, we can figure out how long to get to wall ($\frac{s}{v}$) and how long to hear the echo ($2\frac{s}{v}$)

#### Refraction
- When a wave enters a *new medium*  at an angle other than $90\degree$, then it will **change direction**
- Velocity ($v$) changes
	- Since $f$ cannot change, then to change $v$, $\lambda$ must change (wavelength will change)
- **Light** decreases in speed with increasing density of the medium
- **Sound** increases in speed with increasing density of the medium
- *If entering a FASTER medium,* then the refracted ray bends away from the normal, and if entering a *SLOWER* medium, the refracter bay bends towards the normal
	- The **normal** is the **perpendicular line that can be made with the surface** (this is why the wave does not change direction if it enters perpendicular to the medium)

#### Diffraction
- *Radiate*: Point source emitting things
- Occurs when waves either pass through a gap or around an obstacle and the wave fronts are deformed (bend). IF $\lambda \geq d$ where $\lambda$ = wavelength and $d=$ size of gap
