#### Waves
- Are the ***transfer of energy*** from one place to another without the *net* displacement of matter.
	- **Mechanical Waves** have an absolute requirement for a medium e.g. Sound cannot propogate through a vacuum
	- **Non-Mechanical Waves (EMR)** - does not require a medium, can propogate through a vacuum but can also propogate through other media - e.g light
- The **direction** of displacement of particles in the media
	- *Transverse* waves - perpendicular to the direction of propogation
	- *Longitudinal* waves - parallel to the direction of propogation

- Below, Amplitude (A) is the max displacement of a particle in the medium from the mean/ medium position (x-axis). For a displacement-distance graph, the time between two consecutive *in phase* points gives the wavelength of the wave. Period (T) is the time it takes for a single wave to pass a given point. Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive in-phase points.
- *Frequency* cannot be directly gotten from a wave graph $\downarrow$, $T=\dfrac{1}{f}$
- $V=\lambda f=\dfrac{\lambda}{T}$ where $V$ is speed in $m\space s^{-1}$, $\lambda$ is wavelength in metres, and $T$ is period in seconds, and $f$ is the frequency in $s^{-1}, Hz$

#### Wave Behaviours
- **Reflection** - when energy is incident upon a surface, or a boundry between two different media, then some/all of the energy rebounds back into the original medium.
