#### Waves
- Are the ***transfer of energy*** from one place to another without the *net* displacement of matter.
	- **Mechanical Waves** have an absolute requirement for a medium e.g. Sound cannot propogate through a vacuum
	- **Non-Mechanical Waves (EMR)** - does not require a medium, can propogate through a vacuum but can also propogate through other media - e.g light
- The **direction** of displacement of particles in the media
	- *Transverse* waves - perpendicular to the direction of propogation
	- *Longitudinal* waves - parallel to the direction of propogation
