##### The Basics
- **Accuracy** is how close our measurement is to the actual/real value
	- When describing, things are not 'reasonably accurate' - they are either accurate or not accurate
	- $\pm 5\%$
- **Precision** in terms of a measuring instrument, is the fineness of the scale on the instrument
	- A property of the instrument itself
	- We use experimental preceision - how far apart from average experimental value
- **Reliable**  - when additional trials give a consistent result
- **Validity** occurs when every variable is controlled as you intend it - no other variable is having an impact on our experiment other than the deliberate experimentation of the independant bariable and the resulting response of the dependant variable.
