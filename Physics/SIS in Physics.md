##### The Basics
- **Accuracy** is how close our measurement is to the actual/real value
	- When describing, things are not 'reasonably accurate' - they are either accurate or not accurate
	- $\pm 5\%$
- **Precision** in terms of a measuring instrument, is the fineness of the scale on the instrument
	- A property of the instrument itself
	- We use experimental preceision - how far apart from average experimental value
- **Reliable**  - when additional trials give a consistent result
- **Validity** occurs when every variable is controlled as you intend it - no other variable is having an impact on our experiment other than the deliberate experimentation of the independant bariable and the resulting response of the dependant variable.

##### Uncertainty & Error
- 3 Classes
	- **Measurement error** - unavoidable, property of the measuring instrument
		- Absolute Error - of the instrument, $= \frac{1}{2}$ of the smalles unit of scale on the instrument - e.g. 30cm ruler with millimeter increments = 0.5mm. So whatever value you get would be $n\pm 0.5mm$
		- Percentage Error - this is $$=(\frac{absolute \space error}{measurement}*100)\%$$
	- **Systematic error** - affect the results such that all measurements are skewed away from some ideal value sought
	- **Random** - affect the results in a way which, if truly random, tend to cancel each other out
