- Formula - $p=mv$
	- Momentum is a vector quantity
	- Measured in $kg \space m\space s^{-1}$
	- Is a **conserved quantity**
- **Conservation of momentum**
	- $\sum\limits P$ before = $\sum\limits P$ after.
	- i.e $m_{1}u_{1}+m_{2}u_{2}=m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}$ 
- You **must** put your answer in scientific notation #testanswer 
	- i.e $100kg \space m \space s^{-1}$ should be $10.0 \times 10^{2}$
	- Also, $ms^{-1}$ is milliseconds, so you should write $m \space s^{-1}$ for meters per second
- **Question**
	- A truck of mass $1.50t$ is travelling west at $110 \space kmh^{-1}$ when it has a head on collision with a car of $750kg$ travelling $74 kmh^{-1}$ east. If the final velocity of the truck is $46.7kmh^{-1}$ west, what is the final velocity of the car in $kmh^{-1}$.
- $\triangle P=P_{Final}-P_{Initial}$
	- Two dimensional problem.

##### Conservation of Mass
- [Any conserved quantity] can be neither created or destroyed

##### Energy
- Anything that is not matter is energy

#### Rate of change of momentum
- Is measured in $kg \space m\space s^{-2}$ which is actually just $N$
- **Impulse**, on the other hand is measured in $Ns$ - <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Newton seconds, not seconds per newton</mark>
	- It is formulated $F\triangle t=m(v-u)$
	- Because $F=ma$, and $a=\frac{\triangle v}{\triangle t}$
	- $F\triangle t=m \triangle v$
	- then, $F\triangle t=m(v-u)$
