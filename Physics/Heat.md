### Definitions
- **Three** big ones
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Temperature:</mark> the average kinetic energy of the particles of a substance ($J$)
		- temperature of object depends on average of particles but not on their potential energies
		- two objects are in **thermal equilibrium** when their temperatures are equal, and **heat** transfer between the objects reaches equivalent rates between the two objects
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Internal Energy:</mark> the sum of the potential and kinetic energies of the particles
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Heat:</mark> Thermal energy which is transferred from a hotter object to a cooler one.
		- consider probability; it is more likely for hot to cold than cold to hot

#### Kinetic theory of matter
- **Basic assumptions**
	- All matter consists of **tiny particles,** such as atoms, molecules and ions
	- **Electrical force**s, both attractive and repulsive, exist between the particles
	- All particles move (for our intents and purposes) ***randomly*** and hence all possess kinetic energy (unless they are at absolute zero)
	- Collisions between particles involve no loss of kinetic energy, except where they lead to chemical reactions: particle collisions are said to be **perfectly elastic**
- This creates the **three basic states
	- **Solid**: particles in** fixed position** (fixed shape & volume) unless [[#Thermal Conductivity & Expansion]] occurs.
	- **Liquid:** particles are **attracted to each other** but are **able to move past each other** i.e. there is a continual breaking and making of bonds
	- **Gas:** particles are **not attracted** to each other, there is **no fixed volume/shape**, 
#### Problem Set
- 10.1
	- a) thermal energy is produced by solar radiation
	- b) electrical energy
	- c) friction produced by kinetic energy of the vehicle
- 10.2
	- 21.8%
- 10.3
	- The environment is warmer, that is, the gases in the atmosphere have a higher temperature. Due to this, it's heat is higher and so the engines of the cars that are running increase in temperature
- 10.4
	- a) 60%
	- b) An experiment could measure the motion of the ball over a certain period of time, and use the SUVAT equations
	- c) It is converted into kinetic energy; both within the ball (internal energy increasing its temperature and heat) and sound in the form of mechanical waves.
- 10.5
	- a) thermal energy
	- b) it increases the internal energy and thus temperature of the brake discs, increasing its heat, which leads to energy being dissipated into the surrounding environment
- 10.6
	- Since the freezer has low internal energy, it's temperature is low, and thus heat will transfer from the surroundings into the freezer, leading to the room becoming cooler.
- 10.7
	- A heat 'pump' does exactly that - instead of turning some form of energy into internal energy in the gases of the room, it simply uses energy to transfer internal energy from some place into the room, thus making it appear as if more energy is produced than put in 
- 10.8
	- a) The existence of heat leads to a higher entropy in a system. Thus, thermal energy is a type of low grade energy
	- b) It has a higher entropy, a higher level of disorder, randomness and a lower level of control
	- c) A uranium pellet, which has not been doped.
- 10.9
	-  

#### Thermal Conductivity & Expansion
- Poor electrical conductors tend to be poor thermal conductors
	- they use **mobile particles** as a mechanism to transfer energy, such as **electrons**
- **Thermal expansion** refers to particles in a substance gaining thermal energy, leading to particles vibrating more (as per the kinetic theory of matter), thus expanding more in every dimension
	- can cause problems - e.g. railroad tracks

#### Thermal Equilibrium
- Two substances in contact (easy to picture solids, but can be **any state**) which are of different temperatures will continuously transfer heat from hotter to colder substances until they reach thermal equilibrium i.e. **the same temperature**

#### Specific Heat Capacity
- The amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1kg of a substance by 1KF 

#### The practical
- $3.2$ in STAWA
- go to room <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">AU23</mark>
- wherever they mention nickel, ignore it
- we're using stainless steel; it has corrosion so the specific heat capacity will be different to normal stainless steel
	- even if the numbers are way off, do it anyway
- also stawa sets it up on a weird angle.
	- instead we have the gauze, bunsen, tripod. however we want a clap holding the test tube and stuff
	- nestle the thermometer as deep as possible amongst the metal beads within the test tube
