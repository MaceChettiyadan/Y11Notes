- **Scalars** are fully defined by magnitude only
	- Distance - this is the distance travelled from A to B
- **Vectors** have a magnitude and direction
	- May put arrow on top to indicate $\vec{s}$
	- Exceptions do exist if the question asks for the **magnitude** (understand context of question)
	- Also, **if given compass directions**, then return in compass directions.
		- Don't write compass directions if they are not explicitly given; for rivers, for example, just write up/downstream if North not given
	- Assume vehicles are moving forward
	- Assume falling objects are going down
- Below is a vector quantity table;

| **Vector**   | **Symbol**           | **Scalar**  | **Units**  |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Displacement | $s$                  | Distance    | $m$        |
| Velocity     | $v$ ($=\frac{s}{t}$) | Speed       | $m s^{-1}$ |
| Acceleration | $a$ ($=\frac{v}{t}$) |             | $ms^{-2}$  |
| Force        | $F$ ($=ma$)          |             | $N$        |
|              | $W$ ($=F_s$)         | Work        | $J$        |
|              |                      | Mass        | $KG$       |
|              |                      | Temperature |      $C$ or $K$           |

##### Vector vs Free body diagram
- Free body diagrams show **all *real* forces acting on a body**
	- $W$ - weight/gravitational force
	- $Lift$ - lift force
	- $Drag$ - drag force
	- $Thrust$ - thrust force
	- Don't write acceleration - it isn't a force!
	- The diagram is centered on a dot
- **Vector diagrams** show the resolved vectors acting in a situation
	- Must use arrows (same for FBD)
	- Must have the same vector quantity
	- On each side
	- Must be resolved
	- Define own compass direction (for relevant questions)
	- Head to Tail
