## Half-Life
- The time it takes for half of the radioisotopes in a sample of a given radioisotope to undergo decay.
- *Mass does not disappear* - if the question asks how much sample is left, it is the **same**
- **3** ways to measure
	- Number of nuclei - however, the decayed nuclides are now nuclides of a different isotope
	- Mass - but actual mass of entire sample will not change significantly since little actual mass is lost because of the existence of other isotopes
	- Actually measured disintegrations per second ($DPS$ measured in becquerels - $Bq$)

## Mass Defect/Nuclear Binding Energy
- The fact that the *mass of any given nuclide is less than the sum of the individual masses of its protons and neutrons* of which it is composed
	- i.e. there is a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">mass defect</mark>
	- This was **converted to energy** when the **nuclide was formed**, related by the equation $E=mc^2$
- **Nuclear binding energy *is not the energy holding the nucleus together*
	- Instead, it is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">the energy that was lost in forming the nucleus</mark>
	- It is the same amount of energy that is required to break the nucleus apart.
- One AMU (Atomic Mass Unit) is $1/12$ the mass of a carbon-12 atom

##### Masses
- Proton: 1.007276
- Neutron: 1.008665
- Boron-11: 11.009305
- $1u$ = $1.66\times 10^{-27} = 931 MeV$

## Nuclear Fission
- Bombard large nuclei with neutrons, then they have a tendency to become unstable and can split into $2+$ fragments.

##### Stations
- Fuel - $U^{235}$
- Fuel rods
- Moderator - slows down neutrons longer to be captured by nuclides - water, heavy water, graphite
- Control Rods - absorb excess neutrons - boron and cadmium
- Coolant - water, heavy water

##### Waste Management
- **Low Level**
	- Clothing, wrappings, containers, tools
	- Incineration - i.e. putting it into the atmosphere, the isotope isn't actually destroyed
	- Burying - fine, don't go digging
- **Medium Level**
	- 
- **High Level**
