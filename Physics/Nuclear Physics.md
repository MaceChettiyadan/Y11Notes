#### Half-Life
- The time it takes for half of the radioisotopes in a sample of a given radioisotope to undergo decay.
- *Mass does not disappear* - if the question asks how much sample is left, it is the **same**
- **3** ways to measure
	- Number of nuclei - however, the decayed nuclides are now nuclides of a different isotope
	- Mass - but actual mass of entire sample will not change significantly since little actual mass is lost because of the existence of other isotopes
	- Actually measured disintegrations per second ($DPS$ measured in becquerels - $Bq$)

#### Mass Defect/Nuclear Binding Energy
- The fact that the *mass of any given nuclide is less than the sum of the individual masses of its protons and neutrons* of which it is composed
	- i.e. there is a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">mass defect</mark>
	- This was **converted to energy** when the **nuclide was formed**, related by the equation $E=mc^2$
- **Nuclear binding energy *is not the energy holding the nucleus together*
	- Instead, it is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">the energy that was lost in forming the nucleus</mark>
