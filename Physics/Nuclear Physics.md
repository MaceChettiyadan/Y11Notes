#### Half-Life
- The time it takes for half of the radioisotopes in a sample of a given radioisotope to undergo decay.
- *Mass does not disappear* - if the question asks how much sample is left, it is the **same**
- **3** ways to measure
	- Number of nuclei - however, the decayed nuclides are now nuclides of a different isotope
	- Mass - but actual mass of entire sample will not change significantly since little actual mass is lost because of the existence of other isotopes
	- Actually measured disintegrations per second ($DPS$)
