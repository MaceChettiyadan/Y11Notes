#### Energy
- Is the **ability to do work**, measured in $Joules \space (J)$
	- Work, then, is measured in joules too. It is the change in energy of an object, so basically $\Delta E$
	- This is $F_s$
- **Energy** is a *conserved quantity*. Then, *Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, though it can be transferred or transformed.*
	- Transfer = type of energy is unchanged
	- Transform = one type of energy becomes another type
- We're only really interested in two types of energy;
	- Mechanical energy i.e kinetic and gravitational potential, 
		- Kinetic: $E_x=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. This is a **scalar**
		- Gravitational Potential: $E_p=mgh$. This is
		- Applied Force: $F_{s}=Nm$
	- For objects in motion (inc. stationary), it is assumed that their total mechanical energy (TME) = $E_{x}+E_{p}$ will be constant for that object.

###### Question
- A bird realises it is a flightless bird and plummets to the ground. What is its final velocity as it hits the ground? It has a mass of $15.4kg$ and falls from a height of $1.58m$. It was "flying" at a speed of $3.44m\space s^{-1}$
**To solve,**
- Construct a vector diagram
	- We know energy is conserved, so both things need to add up in both states.
	- There is *no initial kinetic energy* and *no gravitational potential energy* in the end
	- **So,** the gravitational potential energy at the start is equal to the kinetic energy at the end.
	- $mgh=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ $\therefore v=\sqrt{2gh}=5.56m \space s^{-1}$. 
	- Now we have the horizontal and vertical vector components, so we can determine the resultant, which is **the final velocity.**

#### Power
- Is $\frac{work}{time}$ i.e the rate at which work is done.
