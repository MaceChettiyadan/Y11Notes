### The nuclear model
- Bohr's model of the atom; each atom is made up of a nucleus, which has the nuclides protons and neutrons, and electrons
	- Protons and neutrons comprise most of the mass (electrons have a negligible mass)
	- Protons are positively charged; neutrons neutral and electrons negatively

### Nuclear Stability
- The result of the strong nuclear force between nuclides, holding them and therefore the atom together.
	- This opposes the electromagnetic force - like charges (in this case, protons) repel
	- The strong nuclear force is more effective at short distances (something something quark gluon)

### Unstable things
- Some nuclides are unstable - there are patterns as to *why*, but we don't have definitive rules - a lot of them just are
	- These ones spontaneously decay
	- Depending on their properties, these nuclides will undergo alpha, beta ($\pm$), or gamma decay
		- This occurs until they become stable nuclides

### Half-Life
- The time it takes for one half of a sample of a radioisotope to decay
	- The half-life indicates the rate of decay
	- Remember half powering

### Alpha, Beta and Gamma
- For the below; ionisation refers to the process whereby an atom gains a positive or negative charge by loss or gain of electron
#### Alpha
- Very ionising
- Stopped by paper
- Is a helium nuclide
	- $$^{a}_{b}X\rightarrow ^{a-4}_{b-2}Y+^{4}_{2}\alpha$$

#### Gamma
- Relatively non-ionising
- Stopped by lead
- EMR
	- $$^{A*}_{Z}X\rightarrow ^{A}_{Z}X+^{0}_{0}\gamma$$

#### Beta
- Ionising
- Stopped by aluminium
- Extremely energised electrons
##### Plus
- A proton decays into a neutron, a positron and a *neutrino*
	- $$^{1}_{1}P\rightarrow ^{0}_{1}\beta + ^{1}_{0}Z$$
##### Minus
- A neutron decays into a proton, electron and an *antineutrino*
	- $$^{3}_{1}H \rightarrow ^{3}_{2}He+^{0}_{-1}e$$

### Absorbed dose and dose equivalent
- Absorbed dose is the amount of radiation that is absorbed by a mass
	- It is measured in milligrays, where grays are the SI unit and calculated $=\frac{E}{m}$
- dose equivalent accounts for the type of radiation using the *quality factor* (on the formula sheet)
	- It is measured in millisieverts, where sieverts are the SI unit and calculated $=\frac{E\times quality \space factor}{m}$

### E=mc^2 in binding energy
- Binding energy is the amount of energy required to bind together the nucleons in a nucleus
- It is the same amount of energy required to break apart the nucleus
- If we measure the mass of the nucleus and of its nuclides, the nucleus has slightly less mass
	- This is because mass - mass defect - is lost when forming the nucleus because some of it is converted to energy - the binding energy
