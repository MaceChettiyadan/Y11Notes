### The nuclear model
- Bohr's model of the atom; each atom is made up of a nucleus, which has the nuclides protons and neutrons, and electrons
	- Protons and neutrons comprise most of the mass (electrons have a negligible mass)
	- Protons are positively charged; neutrons neutral and electrons negatively

### Nuclear Stability
- The result of the strong nuclear force between nuclides, holding them and therefore the atom together.
	- This opposes the electromagnetic force - like charges (in this case, protons) repel
	- The strong nuclear force is more effective at short distances (something something quark gluon)

### Unstable things
- Some nuclides are unstable - there are patterns as to *why*, but we don't have definitive rules - a lot of them just are
	- These ones spontaneously decay
	- Depending on their properties, these nuclides will undergo alpha, beta ($\pm$), or gamma decay
		- This occurs until they become stable nuclides

### Half-Life
- The time it takes for one half of a sample of a radioisotope to decay
	- The half-life indicates the rate of decay
	- Remember half powering

### Alpha, Beta and Gamma
- For the below; ionisation refers to the process whereby an atom gains a positive or negative charge by loss or gain of electron
#### Alpha
- Very ionising
- Stopped by paper
- Is a helium nuclide

#### Gamma
- Relatively non-ionising
- Stopped by lead
- EMR

#### Beta
- Ionising
- Stopped by aluminium
- Extremely energised electrons
