## Databases
### relationship between data and information
- There is a **distinction** between data and information. 
	- **Data** is made up of raw <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">facts and figures</mark>. It is a form of raw information;
	- That is, **Information** is data that has been <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">analysed and interpreted</mark> to produce meaning.

### flat file vs relational database
- A **flat file** database is a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">two-dimensional singular table</mark> database made up of rows of data. It has no relationships between each datum. The most common flat file format is in the **CSV** (Comma separated values) format.
- A **relational** database is made up of multiple tables (entities) that contain records and have multiple fields/attributes. Relational databases, as the name suggests, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">have relationships between pieces of data</mark> through the use of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">unique identifiers called keys</mark>.

### relational database management systems (RDBMS):
#### role of a RDBMS in handling access to data
- An RDBMS provides secure and efficient storage and access to data through features such as data integrity, data security, performance optimisation and data security.

#### independence of data from RDBMS
- data independence from an RDBMS is the **capability for the database structure to be modified without having to rewrite or modify any applications that depend on the database**; while the RDBMS is an interface (API) for modification of the database, it still <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">exists independently of the RDBMS</mark>.
