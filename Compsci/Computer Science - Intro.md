###### Variables
- Are memory addresses in a computer used to store information so that the CPU may use it, for example, $i=0$
- Variables are temporary. They are usually collected by a garbage collector once their purpose is complete.
	- **Constants** are variables that are immutable - they do not change. For example, $pi=3.14$
	- **Global** and **Local** variables. Globals have a global scope (main module). Local variables are only acessible in their own module.
See below; code snippet.
``` javascript
const pi = 3.1415 //constant
let temp_local = 0 //variable - in js, let makes it local
var temp_global = 0 //global
```

###### Pseudocode
- Make sure to include line numbers
- Used to plan out a program logically (in our mind), breaking down complex propgrams into step by step logical thingos for human readable
