### Dedicated to our lord, Big C.
###### Variables
- Are memory addresses in a computer used to store information so that the CPU may use it, for example, $i=0$
- Variables are temporary. They are usually collected by a garbage collector once their purpose is complete.
	- **Constants** are variables that are immutable - they do not change. For example, $pi=3.14$
	- **Global** and **Local** variables. **Globals** have a global scope (main module). **Local** variables are only acessible in their own module.
See below; code snippet.

``` javascript
const pi = 3.1415 //constant
let temp_local = 0 //variable - in js, let makes it local
var temp_global = 0 //global
```

###### Pseudocode
- Make sure to include line numbers
- Used to plan out a program logically (in our mind), breaking down complex programs into step by step logical thingos for human readable


###### Data types
- **For syllabus**
	- Int
	- Float
	- Str
	- Boolean
- Ok but india

### Pseudocode Example
The 'Wilson' Standard (Y10, Mr Wilson)
```python
BEGIN
	INPUT(num1)
	INPUT(num2)
	total <= num1 + num2
	OUPUT(total)
END
```
The 'Chilson' Standard (Y11, Mr Chillapa)
```python
BEGIN
	Num1, Num2, Total are float
	INPUT <= Num1, Num2
	READ <= Num1, Num2
	Total <= Num1 + Num2
	Output <= Total
END
```
