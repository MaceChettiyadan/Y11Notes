#### Public and Private Key Encryption
- Public keys are available for anyone to use.
- The other key is known as the private key - data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key
- Also known as **asymmetric cryptography**
	- It is widely used, especially for TSL/SSL which makes HTTPS possible
- When we send information to a server, anyone can encrypt it but only the server can decrypt it.
