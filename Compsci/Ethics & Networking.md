# Networking
## TCP/IP
- Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol
- Composed of **four** layers

##### Network Layer
- Physical components
- NICs (network interface cards)

##### Transport Layer
- Physical connections and transports between networks and devices.
- [[#Cables]]

##### Internet Layer
- IPv4, IPv6
- ARP

##### Application Layer
- HTTP/HTTPS
- Browser, delivers information
	- Also FTP, SMTP, etc.

# IP addresses
## Subnet Masks
- Splits the IP address into two
	- Identify host computer/device
	- Identify network it belongs to

## IP address
- IP addresses
	- *addresses* for each *device*, analagous to mobile phone numbers
- IPv4 vs IPv6 - 6 offers more security
	- This is because of coincidence, but dont mention that in a test.


# Cables
- **UTP** - Unshielded Twisted Pair
- **STP** - Shielded Twister Pair
- **Fiber**

| Type of Cable               | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| UTP                         |             |            |               |
| STP                         |             |            |               |
| Fiber - Multi Mode          |             |            |               |
| Fiber - Single Mode         |             |            |               |
| Wireless/Microwave/Cellular |             |            |               |

Hub vs Switch
Hub is old school, compare to walkie talkie radios - connect to one channel, it broadcasts to every device
Switch - mobile network, unique addresses, more secure, more privacy, less packet collisions


###### IPv4 vs IPv6
- Different formats. v6 can hold more addresses, as it is 128 bits compared to the v4 standard 64 bits.

###### What is bandwidth?
- 
- 

###### UTP vs Fibre Optic
- 

###### TCP/IP Protocol
- Each layer with a short desc
- Devices that fall into each layer
###### Cisco Network Diagrams how?
