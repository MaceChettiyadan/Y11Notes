- **Inflation** is the persistent and appreciable rise in the general or average level of prices over time
	- Measured by the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Consumer Price Index</mark> - a weighted index based on proportion of income spent on a particular group of items
	- Measures changes in the price of a basket of goods and services bought by households from 1 quarter to the next
- **CPI**
	- Attaches weights to each commodity to reflect importance in pattern of expenditure in an average household
	- Weights change depending on preference or reaction to changes in price
	- Rate: $\frac{[CPI(Y2)-CPI(Y1)]}{CPI(Y1)}\times100$
- **Headline vs Underlying**
	- Headline measure (CPI): the measure that is reported by the media
	- Underlying measure: inflation that best reflects market forces
		- **Trimmed Mean**: remove the most volatile 15% of items from each side of the CPI
		- **Weighted median**: change in middle 50th percentile by weight
		- **CPI excluding volatile items**: Average inflation rate of all items in the CPI basket except for fruits, vegetables or fuels (these are very volatile items)
			- Will always remove the same, volatile elements
- **Limitations of CPI**
	- Only reports price movements in metro areas
	- Does not account for quality of goods and services - only price
	- Not regarded as "true" cost of living index: does not reflect changing consumer preferences or substitutes that consumers make daily
- **Types of inflation**
	- **Demand-pull inflation**: Excess of aggregate demand over aggregate supply at the full employment level of output, and is caused by an increase in aggregate demand
		- Rise in the general price level resulting from an excess of demand over supply
		- "too much money chasing too few goods"
		- Will also push wage prices up with higher demand
	- **Cost push inflation**: Caused by a fall in aggregate supply, in turn resulting from increase in wages or prices of other inputs
		- Rise in production costs are passed on to consumers who have to pay higher prices for final goods and service

## Inflation Questions
1. Why is cost-push  inflation potentially more serious than demand-pull?
	- Cost push is caused by suppliers, who pass costs on to consumers. On the other hand demand-pull is a more theoretical concept, and demand is often much easier to correct than supply shock, where overcoming some scenarios is harder.
2. Explain whether each scenario is CP or DP inflation.
	- Demand-pull
	- Demand-pull
	- Cost-push

## Costs of Inflation
- **Reduces Real Income** (purchasing power)
	- Buy less goods with same money
- **Affects Interest Rates**
	- Real $IR$ (nominal $IR$-inflation) must be positive for lenders to make profit and lend
- **International Competitiveness**
	- Country's exports at disadvantage when domestic inflation is greater than o/s (overseas)
- **Currency depreciation**
	- Less o/s demand for country's goods
- **Capital for labour substitution**
	- Due to wage inflation and structural change
- **Uncertainty for decision makers**
	- Investment decisions, reduce output and employment opportunities
- **Economic Efficiency**
	- People move away form productive to speculative activities (assets, investment): negative impact on economic output
- **Hyperinflation**
	- Above $30\% p.a. \rightarrow$ diversion of efforts towards hoarding or non-productive activities
- **Reduction in income inequality**
	- Bracket creeps: As income rises with inflation, higher margin of tax leading to fewer tax brackets
