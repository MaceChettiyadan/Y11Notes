- Inflation is a persistent and appreciable rise in the general level of prices over time
	- On the converse, we have deflation

## Measurement
- The most familiar measure of the level of inflation in Australia is the **Consumer Price Index**
	- It measures changes in the price of a basket of goods and services bought by Australian consumers in a time period
- Items are classified into eleven major groups, 33 subgroups, and 87 classes of expenditure
	- Different groups and items have different priorities - a rise in fuel prices would have more impact than a rise in cocaine prices (cocaine is illegal, so it has less demand)
	- Thus, the ABS attaches weights to products - these weights may change each year based on a review each December

## Headline vs Underlying inflation
- Headline Measure is the measure reported by the media
- Underlying inflation better represents market forces
		- **Trimmed Mean**: removes the most volatile 15% of items from each side of the CPI
		- **Weighted median**: changes the median by weight
		- **CPI excluding volatile items**: Average inflation rate of all items in the CPI basket except for fruits, vegetables or fuels (these are very volatile items) - this is all constant, unlike trimmed and weighted median.

## Limitations
- Does not account for quality of goods and services - only price
- Does not reflect changing consumer preferences or substitutes that consumers make daily
	- it is more likely to overstate price increases.
- Only reports price movements in metro areas (specifically, capital cities)

## Types
- **Demand-Pull**
	- 'too much money chasing too few goods' - i.e., households and businesses are spending more than they normally would, causing prices to rise due to competition
	- **Indicators** are
		- High levels of consumer confidence
		- Low levels of spare capacity in key industries
		- Rising wages that increase disposable income
		- High levels of credit use
		- Rises in property or share market asset prices
	- For demand-pull, different sectors of the economy will be affected differently
	- Will also push wage prices up with higher demand
- **Cost-Push**
	- Rising output costs are passed onto consumers, who then pay higher prices
	- Episodes of cost-push can be attributed to
		- Rising oil/petrol prices
		- Rising import prices <-- currency depreciation
		- wages rising faster than productivity
		- natural disasters such as flood and drought
- Both are very generalised

## Effects of inflation
- Moderate inflation == good for economy
	- it encourages borrowing and consumption
- Can be a burden if the cash rate (directly influenced by $CPI$) creeps above $4-5\%$.
	- Inflation reduces **real income** or purchasing power
	- It **affects interest rates**, as the **real interest rate** (nominal interest rate - inflation) must be positive
		- this means higher rates are **good for savers**, but **bad for borrowers**
	- It can affect **international competitiveness**, as exports are at a disadvantage (relatively) when domestic inflation is high
	- Can result in **currency depreciation**
		- because there is less overseas demand for a country's good
	- **Capital-for-labour substitutions**
	- Also, **uncertainty** and **economic efficiency** are impacted
