### Intro to Economics
#### Explain the concept of Economics
- Economics deals with two basic facts.
	- People are faced with **limited resources**
	- People have **unlimited wants**
	- This is the **Basic Economic Problem** (BEP)
		- The BEP is a problem of both [[#Scarcity]] and choice
		- To formalise, 'Economics is the study of how people allocate their limited resources to satisfy their unlimited wans - the study of the economic problem, which is one of scarcity and choice.' #testanswer
- To **solve the BEP**, three basic questions should be answered;
	- What to produce?
	- How to produce?
	- For whom to produce?
- In doing so, economics is a **social science**
- Wants are unlimited, recurring, complimentary (iphone -> airpods), specific to a person, location and time, and have varying levels of importance

###### Scarcity
- Anything that has a **price** is **scarce**.
	- **Free goods** are those that are not relatively scarce and do not have a price (for example, air breathed)
- It is important to not confuse scarcity with a shortage
	- A shortage occurs when the supply of something is limited
	- Scarcity is the fundamental issue of infinite wants

###### Choice
- Because of scarcity - because of the limited resources, **we must choose between one option or the other**
	- For example, I have the limited amount of $15 - do i
		- a) Go to the movies or   
		- b) Go to a restaurant?
- Making choices when confronted by scarcity involves a  **trade-off**

#### Distinguish between microeconomics and macroeconomics
- **Macro**economics deals with the economic problem from society's point of view
	- It is concerned with the performance of the whole economy
- **Micro**economics deals with economics from an individual point of view - referring to a small perspective

#### Describe the economic decision-making process
#### Discuss the importance of economic models
#### Demonstrate and explain the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) Model
#### Discuss the characteristics of a market economy

### Demand
#### Define the Law of Demand
#### Explain the relationship between individual and market demand schedules and curves
#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes in price on quantity demanded
#### Discuss the non-price factors affecting demand
#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes in non-price factors on demand

### Supply
#### Define the Law of Supply
#### Explain the relationship between individual and market supply schedules and curves
#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes (in price?) on quantity supplied
#### Discuss the non-price factors affecting supply
#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes in non-price factors on supply

### Equilibrium
#### Outline the concept of market equilibrium
#### Explain the concepts of market clearing, shortages and surpluses
#### Explain the effects of changes in demand and/or supply on market equilibrium, including simultaneous shifts

### Elasticity (PES/D = Price Elasticity of Supply/Demand)
#### Define the concept, and measurement, of PED
#### Explain the determinants of PED
#### Distinguish between goods that are price elastic and inelastic in demand
#### Demonstrate and describe the link between price elasticity of demand and Total Revenue
#### Define the concept of PES
#### Distinguish between goods that are price elastic and inelastic in supply
#### Discuss the application of PED and PES to markets
#### Analyse the importance of PED and PES for business and government, including tax incidence and Price Discrimination

### Market Efficiency
#### Outline the concept of market efficiency in a perfectly competitive market
#### Explain the concepts of consumer surplus, producer surplus, total surplus and deadweight loss
#### Outline the efficiency of market equilibrium i.e. maximising total surplus
#### Discuss how under and overproduction in a market can result in a deadweight loss
#### Demonstrate and explain the effects of a tax and subsidy on a market
#### Demonstrate and explain the effects of a price ceiling and price floor on a market

### Market Failure & Power
#### Define the concept of market failure
#### Outline the characteristics of an imperfectly competitive market
#### Explain the concept and causes of market power
#### Explain how market power can influence market efficiency
#### Discuss the policy options to influence market power, incl. regulation/deregulation and legislation

### Market Failure: Externalities
