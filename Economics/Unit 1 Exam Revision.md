### Intro to Economics
#### Explain the concept of Economics
- Economics deals with two basic facts.
	- People are faced with **limited resources**
	- People have **unlimited wants**
	- This is the **Basic Economic Problem** (BEP)
		- The BEP is a problem of both [[#Scarcity]] and choice
		- To formalise, 'Economics is the study of how people allocate their limited resources to satisfy their unlimited wans - the study of the economic problem, which is one of scarcity and choice.' #testanswer
- To **solve the BEP**, three basic questions should be answered;
	- What to produce?
	- How to produce?
	- For whom to produce?
- In doing so, economics is a **social science**
- Wants are unlimited, recurring, complimentary (iPhone -> Air pods), specific to a person, location and time, and have varying levels of importance

###### Scarcity
- Anything that has a **price** is **scarce**.
	- **Free goods** are those that are not relatively scarce and do not have a price (for example, air breathed)
- It is important to not confuse scarcity with a shortage
	- A shortage occurs when the supply of something is limited
	- Scarcity is the fundamental issue of infinite wants

###### Choice
- Because of scarcity - because of the limited resources, **we must choose between one option or the other**
	- For example, I have the limited amount of $15 - do i
		- a) Go to the movies or   
		- b) Go to a restaurant?
- Making choices when confronted by scarcity involves a  **trade-off**

#### Distinguish between microeconomics and macroeconomics
- **Macro**economics deals with the economic problem from society's point of view
	- It is concerned with the performance of the whole economy
- **Micro**economics deals with economics from an individual point of view - referring to a small perspective

#### Describe the economic decision-making process

#### Discuss the importance of economic models
- A **simplified** representation of economic reality showing the relationship between certain economic variables
	- Not inclusive of all detailed; simplified to show key correlations
- It is assumed that people have **rational self-interest** - that economic decisions are based on a person following a logical process
	- Rationality is determined as benefit exceeding cost
	- Price is useful for measuring both

###### Positive and Normative
- Beside developing models, **developing theory is known as positive economics** - 'what is' in the economy
- On the other hand, normative economics is the domain of 'what should be' - largely opinionated
	- Normative statements involve a **value judgement** - an opinion that one situation is preferable above another

#### Demonstrate and explain the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) Model
- Used to visualise the opportunity cost of producing one good/service over another. **BEP** is best demonstrated with a PPF. There are three main assumptions;
	- Resources are fixed
	- Technology is fixed
	- Economy produces only 2 goods
- Each axis are goods
	- Bowed out curve (realistic)
	- Straight curve (constant opportunity cost)
	- Inside curve - inefficient points
	- Outside - unattainable points
	- On curve - efficient and attainable
	- Curve can shift if technology or resources change

#### Discuss the characteristics of a market economy
- Solves the BEP in a network of separate but interconnected markets
- **Markets have;**
	- Buyers (create demand)
	- Sellers (create supply)
	- A commodity (that is bought or sold)
	- Voluntary exchange (between buyers and sellers)
	- A process, mechanics or arrangement through which buyers and sellers 'meet'
	- Price (dependant on strength of demand and supply)
- Two types;
	- **Product** markets:
		- Demand is created by consumers or households
		- Deal in the buying and selling of goods and services
		- Supply is created by producers and firms
	- **Factor** markets:
		- Deal in the buying and selling of factors of production (Land, Labour, Capital, Enterprise)
		- Demand created by firms
		- Supply created by households

###### Key features of a market economy
- Property rights and private ownership
- Economic freedom (able to choose one's own participation in the economy)
- Self-interest
- Competition
- Moral Hazards (there are consequences of poor decision making)
- Limited role of government (mainly regulatory)

### Demand
#### Define the Law of Demand
- There is an inverse relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded, due to; #testanswer 
	- **Substitution** effect - when a product increases in price, consumers substitute for a cheaper good
	- **Income** effect - when a product becomes more expensive, it takes up a larger portion of a consumers' income and so the consumer has less to spend on other goods
		- The **purchasing power** of income is reduced

#### Explain the relationship between individual and market demand schedules and curves
- The **demand curve** is downward sloping, labelled 'D'. X-axis is labelled as quantity, and the Y-axis as price.
- The **individual demand curve** is;
	- The demand curve for an individual consumer
- The **market demand curve** is;
	- The curve obtained from the horizontal summation of individual demand curves (i.e the average basically)

#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes in price on quantity demanded
- **Movement** - a movement *along* the curve occurs when there is a **price change** (increase/decrease)
	- Expansion in demand = decrease in price
	- Contraction in demand = increase in price
	- Label points $P_{1,}D_1$ and $P_2,D_2$, etc.

#### Discuss the non-price factors affecting demand
- **Non-Price Factors**,
	- ***T*astes and preference** (changes in taste and preference towards a product)
	- ***E*xpectations of consumers** - consumers may **decrease** consumption $\rightarrow$ **demand** if they are **expecting prices to fall**
	- ***P*rice of related** - two relationships
		- **Substitutes** - for example, green to red apples - if the **price** of a **substitute good increases**, the **demand** of the good **increases** (relatively cheaper)
		- **Complements** - if the **price** of a **complementary good increases**, the **demand** of the good **decreases** as the two products tend to be purchased together - for example, phones and phone cases
	- ***I*ncome** (specifically level of *disposable* income)
		- **Normal** goods - As **income increases**, **demand increases** (common sense)
		- **Inferior** goods - goods of lower quality - as **income increases**, people move towards **higher quality substitutes** away from the inferior goods, leading to a **decrease** in **demand** 
	- ***D*emographic factors** - anything such as age, gender, socioeconomic factors - e.g. an aging population will demand more aged care services
	- Acronym is **TEPID**

#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes in non-price factors on demand
- **Shift** - the quantity demanded of the good changes at every price due to **non-price** factors
	- Rightward shift = increase in demand
	- Leftward shift = decrease in demand
	- Label curves $D_{1},D_2,...$, shift is diagonal
- For shifts, you must write at the end *at every single price point* #testanswer 

### Supply
#### Define the Law of Supply
- In most cases, there is a **positive relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied** of that good #testanswer 
	- At **higher prices**, suppliers are willing to produce more as it means they can **earn more profit**

#### Explain the relationship between individual and market supply schedules and curves
- **Market Supply Curve**
	- The curve obtained from the horizontal summation of individual supply curves
- **Individual Supply Curve**
	- A supply curve relating to an individual producer

#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes (in price?) on quantity supplied
- Price can have either a **contractionary** or **expansionary** effect on the supply curve
	- This is a **movement** along the existing supply curve
	- **Expansions** are an increase in price
	- **Contractions** are a decrease in price

#### Discuss the non-price factors affecting supply
 **Expectations of Producers**
		- This is like expected future prices; expected price changes cause suppliers to alter current supply to take advantage of future prices
- **Technology**
	- Improvement in technology can reduce production costs, allowing suppliers to produce more at a lower cost
	- Increase in supply is show as a rightward shift of the supply curve
- **Prices of other goods**
	- If the price of a related good increases, the supplier can shift production to increase the quantity supplied of the related good
- **Input prices**
	- Production costs - if the input prices go down, supply can increase
	- If input prices go up, supply decreases
- **Government Regulation**
	- Government regulations influence the number of suppliers in the market, which increases or decreases market supply
	- Government regulations can take the form of
		- Taxes
		- Tariffs
		- Subsidies
		- Quotas

#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes in non-price factors on supply
- This has **shift** effect on the curve, where quantity produced changes at every price point
	- Rightward shifts $\rightarrow$ **increase** in supply
	- Leftward shift $\rightarrow$ **decrease** in supply

### Equilibrium
#### Outline the concept of market equilibrium
- **Equilibrium Price** is the price that clears the market, where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied
	- Changes in the market result in temporary surpluses or shortages which then cause price to change to reach new equilibrium
- Occurs through the **price mechanism**
	- This is the process by which the forces of demand and supply interact to determine the price of a good or service $\rightarrow$ helps to clear shortages and surpluses within the market
- **Adam Smith's Invisible Hand** theory relates to the unobservable market force that helps the demand and supply of goods in a free market to reach equilibrium automatically
	- Enabling people to trade freely

#### Explain the concepts of market clearing, shortages and surpluses
A **shortage** is where quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied
	- Consumers **bid** among themselves for the limited goods so the price of the good increases
	- In the diagram below, we can see that at $P_2$, Quantity supplied is much lower than demanded, so there is a shortage, away from the eqauilibrium of Pe. **One thing missing from the diagram:** the area of shortage should be indicated
		- For this **market to clear**, for equilibrium to be achieved again, *Consumers will bid amongst themselves for the limited supply, increasing the price and leading to a contractionary movement along the demand curve. Because of this, there will be an expansionary movement along the supply curve, achieving market equilibrium again.* #testanswer 

![[ShortageDiagramEcon.png|400]]

- **On the other hand,** surplus is when the quantity supplies exceeds the quantity demanded
	- Firms lower their prices to clear **excess stock**. The same as the above diagram, but the surplus is above the equilibrium
	- For this **market to clear**, *Suppliers will lower their prices in order to sell excess stock, leading to a contractionary movement along the supply curve. Due to these lowered prices, there will be increased demand - an expansionary movement along the demand curve. Together, these movements will achieve market equilibrium.* #testanswer 
- **Both surplus and shortages** occur because prices are either below or above $P_e$. (below for shortage, above for surplus)

#### Explain the effects of changes in demand and/or supply on market equilibrium, including simultaneous shifts
- When there is a **one-way** shift in demand/supply there will be a **temporary shortage** or **temporary surplus**
	- The market will clear, however
	- **To explain a one-way shift** #testanswer 
		1. Identify the non-price factor
		2. Does it lead to an increase/decrease - rightward or leftward shift
		3. At original price, compare quantity demanded and supplied of new curve
		4. Identify temporary shortage/surplus
		5. Action taken to clear the market - by the consumers, or the producers
		6. Expansion/contraction in demand and supply curves
		7. The new equilibrium, comparing it to the original
- When there is a **simultaneous** shift, things get a bit goofy.
	- One of the values will always be indeterminate.
		- For example, Inc. Supply and Dec. Demand: inc. supply will push price down and quantity up, dec. demand will push price down and quantity down.
			- Therefore, quantity is indeterminate (it is being stretched up and down!)
			- There is a decrease in supply.

### Elasticity (PES/D = Price Elasticity of Supply/Demand)
#### Define the concept, and measurement, of PED
**Price elasticity of demand** measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price #testanswer 
	- Can be calculated by Percentage Change (Point Method 1) - $$Ed = \frac{\%change \space in \space quantity \space demanded}{\% change \space in \space price}$$
		- Also, the Midpoint Method - $$\frac{(Q_2-Q_1)/[(Q_2+Q_1)/2]}{(P_2-P_1)/[(P_2+P_1)/2]}$$
		- Point Method 2 $$\frac{\triangle Q}{Q}\times \frac{P}{\triangle P}$$

#### Explain the determinants of PED
- There are **five main** determinants/factors of **PED**
	- **The availability of *substitutes*** - if there are substitutes available, a good would be much more elastic
	- **Whether the good is a *necessity* or a *luxury*** - necessities would be inelastic, while luxuries would be elastic
	- **Proportion of income spent** - cheaper goods tend to be inelastic and unresponsive to price change, so higher income spent $\rightarrow$ more elastic
	- **Time period considered** - the more time to **react** to a price change, the more elastic a good gets. For example, for petrol, if the price increases you will likely immediately still need petrol, but in time you could change to other substitutes
	- **The definition of the market** - Narrower categories (fruits $\rightarrow$ bananas) produce more substitutes, and in this example there are many types of fruits. Narrower markets are more responsive.
#### Distinguish between goods that are price elastic and inelastic in demand
- **Two categories**
	- **Price Elastic** products are ones where the *quantity demanded of the product is relatively responsive to changes in price*
		- Percentage change in quantity demanded $>$ percentage change in price
		- $|Ed|>1$
		- These products usually have relatively close substitutes
		- To graph, a very steep curve
	- **Price Inelastic** products are ones where the *quantity demanded of the product is relatively unresponsive to changes in price*
		- Percentage change in quantity demanded $<$ percentage change in price
		- $|Ed|<1$
		- These products cannot be substituted very well usually
		- To graph, a very flat curve

###### Special Situations
- $+$ **Special Situations**
	- **Perfectly elastic** - $Ed=\infty$, i.e changes in price cause an *infinity* change in quantity demanded
		- So, if price changes, quantity demanded falls to *zero*
		- Reflects a perfectly competitive market
		- To graph, a full flat curve
	- **Perfectly inelastic** - $Ed = 0$
		- Quantity demanded remains the same regardless of price
		- Reflects a market where there is *fixed demand* regardless of price - usually *needs* such as drugs.
		- To graph, a vertical line.
	- **Unitary Elastic** - $Ed = 1$
		- Changes in price *equal* changes in quantity demanded

#### Demonstrate and describe the link between price elasticity of demand and Total Revenue
- **Total Revenue** is $P\times Q$
	- Graphically, this is the box of $PQ$, with a corner $(0,0)$
	- From here, we can calculate gains and losses (difference in boxes)
	- **Effect of changes in price on total revenue** is dependant on the price elasticity of the product;
		- For an inelastic good, *price has a direct relationship* to total revenue (inc. price = inc. total revenue)
		- For an elastic good, *price has an inverse relationship* to total revenue (inc. price = dec. total revenue)
		- Unitary goods have a *constant total revenue*

###### Tax Revenue & Elasticity
- Depending on elasticity, **tax revenue** and the burden of tax would vary
	- Tax incidence/burden of the tax: Who bears the majority of the tax
	- If a good is price inelastic in demand, the amount of tax revenue is higher and the burden of the tax falls more on the consumers
		- Relatively **small** change in quantity demanded
		- Think about cigarettes; it is inelastic and people will buy no matter what. The burden then falls on the consumers due to this.
	- If a good is price elastic in demand, the amount of tax revenue is lower and the burden of the tax falls more on the producers
		- Relatively **large** change in quantity demanded

#### Define the concept of PES
- Defined as *The responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price* #testanswer 

#### Distinguish between goods that are price elastic and inelastic in supply
| **Elasticity**      | **Elasticity coefficient** | **Interpretation of Elasticity Coefficient**                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Elastic             | $E>1$                      | Percentage change in QS is greater than the percentage change in price. Relatively close substitutes         |
| Inelastic           | $E<1$                      | Percentage change in QS is lesser than the percentage change in price. Not many close substitutes          |
| Unitary             | $E=1$                      | Percentage change in QS is equal to percentage change in price                 |
| Perfectly Inelastic | $E=0$                      | Percentage change in QS is independant to change in price; it is unresponsive. No substitutes usually. |
| Perfectly Elastic   | $Ed=\infty$                | A small change in price will lead to a complete drop in QS or increase. Many close substitutes.                                                                              |

#### Explain the determinants of PES
- **Time**
	- Similar to demand; in the short run, goods will be priced inelastic because ***they won't be responsive***.
	- In the long run, there is more time for firms to respond to price changes
- **Nature of the industry**
	- What kind of industry it is. A market that produces pencils can easily change production, whereas in a market for agriculture, there is heavy time taken for production.
- **Ability to store inventories**
	- If a business is able to easily store inventories, then it is going to more responsive and elastic in supply

#### Discuss the application of PED and PES to markets

#### Analyse the importance of PED and PES for business and government, including tax incidence and Price Discrimination
- Significant to **firms**
	- Monopoly/Market power - setting prices to influence $TR$
	- Price Discrimination: To maximise $TR$
- Significant to **households**
	- Can control demand if aware of elasticity and influence on prices
- Significant to **Government**
	- Tax Incidence
	- Inelastic - greater incidence on consumers, greater tax revenue
	- Elastic - lesser incidence on consumers, lower tax revenue


### Market Efficiency
#### Outline the concept of market efficiency in a perfectly competitive market
- **Efficiency** means producing the goods that society wants at the lowest possible cost.
	- An efficient outcome means that it is not possible to make someone better off without making someone worse off

#### Explain the concepts of consumer surplus, producer surplus, total surplus and deadweight loss
###### The *consumer* surplus ($CS$)
- **Consumer Surplus** is the difference between what a consumer is prepared to pay and what they actually pay in the market #testanswer 
- **Marginal Benefit** is the extra benefit from consuming one extra unit of the good or service
- The demand curve is what the consumer is actually willing and able to pay
- However, they could actually pay something lower; the difference would be the *consumer surplus*
![[ConsumerSurplus.svg]]

###### The *producer* surplus ($PS$)
- This is related to the amount the producer is *willing* to receive.
	- **Formally**, the difference between what a producer is willing to receive and what they actually receive in a market #testanswer 
	- **Marginal** cost is the extra opportunity cost of producing one more unit of a good or service
- The same concept as consumer surplus; the difference is *producer surplus*
![[ProducerSurplus.svg]]
- ***Combining both diagrams,*** **total surplus** is the measure of the net benefits to society from the production and consumption of the good #testanswer 
	- This is equal to the $PS+CS$
	- **Allocative efficiency** is achieved

#### Outline the efficiency of market equilibrium i.e. maximising total surplus


#### Discuss how under and overproduction in a market can result in a deadweight loss
**Deadweight loss** is a loss in total surplus that is avoidable #testanswer 
	- The situations we have to deal with are where price is *above* and *below* the equilibrium
	- A diagram for *above*; it is important to note that $PS$ is not a triangle, but instead the area above the supply curve below P1 ![[TSPGreaterthanE.svg]]
	- And another, for *below* ![[TSPLessthanE.svg]]
- **Also,** when *quantity* is *above* and *below* the equilibrium.![[QTYDWL.svg]] ![[QTYDWLb.svg]]
#### Demonstrate and explain the effects of a tax and subsidy on a market
###### Tax
- **Why do governments tax** if it introduces inefficiency?
	- Can aid in the redistribution of income
	- To correct externalities
	- To earn revenue
- **Impact of tax**
	- Reduces quantity while increasing price
	- Tax incidence depends on the elasticity of the good/service
	- Creates a DWL
**To explain either,**
1. Original P/Qty
2. Implement government policy
3. New price/quantity
4. Tax Revenue
5. CS/PS/TS/DWL
6. Conclusion on efficiency

-  **Direct tax**
	- e.g. **income tax**
- **Indirect tax**
	- Consumers do not pay the tax directly, but are affected through changes in the price of the good or service
		- **Specific tax**: the tax is a fixed amount or is a set sum of money per unit
		- **Ad Valorem** tax: Where the tax is a percentage of the value of the good or service, e.g. GST

###### Subsidies
- A payment by the government to a firm to reduce production costs and increase output #testanswer 
- The **aim** is to encourage production of goods with positive externalities
	- Allow the producer to export more
	- Aid expansion of the firm
- **Impact of subsidies**
	- DWL as part of government expenditure on the subsidy is not translated into either consumer of producer surplus

#### Demonstrate and explain the effects of a price ceiling and price floor on a market
###### Price Ceilings
- **Price Ceilings** are the highest price that a producer can charge on a good
- Is usually *below* the equilibrium price
- Intended to keep prices affordable for majority of the population
- **Need for rationing process** to regulate demand, but this could lead to a **black market**
 
###### Price Floors
- **Minimum Price** that a producer can charge on a good
- Is usually *above* the equilibrium price
- Designed to ensure that there is a minimum income received by producers
- However, this could result in *informal illegal markets* where workers are paid less than the minimum wage.

**To explain either,**
1. Original Pe and Qe
2. Implement price ceiling or floor
3. New price and Quantity
4. Compare Qs and Qd $\rightarrow$ shortage/surplus
5. CS/PS/TS/DWL
	- Talk about changes in CS/PS/TS, then talk about loss in efficiency i.e. DWL.

### Market Failure & Power
#### Define the concept of market failure
- Market failure is the situation defined by the inefficient distribution of goods and services in the free market

#### Outline the characteristics of an imperfectly competitive market
- A market that is competitive is characterised by
	- A relatively **large number of firms**
	- Firms not having [[#Market Power]]
	- Firms not **differentiating** their products
	- No **barriers to entry** - no licences, blocking of resources, etc.
- However, when these conditions *are not met*, then the market is considered **imperfectly competitive market**.
	- Synergy, Australia Post


#### Explain the concept and causes of market power
- A firm has **market power** if it can affect the market price by varying its output.
- Monopoly and oligopoly firms have lots of market power
- Firms with market power will attempt to maximize profit
	- In doing so, their priorities may not align with society's, and thus a *socially optimal level of output* may not be produced

#### Explain how market power can influence market efficiency
- A competitive market (with firms not having market power) will produce where demand equals supply
	- At the equilibrium, we know $TS$ is maximized, so the market is as efficient as possible
- In the case of **market power**, quantity will not be at this equilibrium, and thus a deadweight loss is created
	- This means that *market efficiency is reduced if firms have market power*

#### Discuss the policy options to influence market power, incl. regulation/deregulation and legislation
##### Regulation
- There is a DWL due to underproduction.
- If there is a natural monopoly, it is not in society's interest to break it up into smaller firms
	- This would result in *higher firms*
- Governments usually **regulate** natural monopolies to ensure more desirable price and quantity outcomes
	- Governments also control who enters the market
##### Deregulation
- Government regulations that restrict competition include
	- Limiting the number of businesses
	- Limiting ability to compete
	- Reduce the incentives for businesses to compete
	- Limiting the choice and information available to consumers
- These can be *deregulated* to increase competition
##### Legislation
- Put in place to limit anti-competitive behaviours to achieve a greater degree of allocative efficiency
- **ACCC** aims to protect, strengthen and supplement the way competition works in Australian markets and industries
	- They enfore the competition and consumer act 2010 and other legislation prommoting competition and fair trading
