### Intro to Economics
#### Explain the concept of Economics
- Economics deals with two basic facts.
	- People are faced with **limited resources**
	- People have **unlimited wants**
	- This is the **Basic Economic Problem** (BEP)
		- The BEP is a problem of both [[#Scarcity]] and choice
		- To formalise, 'Economics is the study of how people allocate their limited resources to satisfy their unlimited wans - the study of the economic problem, which is one of scarcity and choice.' #testanswer
- To **solve the BEP**, three basic questions should be answered;
	- What to produce?
	- How to produce?
	- For whom to produce?
- In doing so, economics is a **social science**
- Wants are unlimited, recurring, complimentary (iPhone -> Air pods), specific to a person, location and time, and have varying levels of importance

###### Scarcity
- Anything that has a **price** is **scarce**.
	- **Free goods** are those that are not relatively scarce and do not have a price (for example, air breathed)
- It is important to not confuse scarcity with a shortage
	- A shortage occurs when the supply of something is limited
	- Scarcity is the fundamental issue of infinite wants

###### Choice
- Because of scarcity - because of the limited resources, **we must choose between one option or the other**
	- For example, I have the limited amount of $15 - do i
		- a) Go to the movies or   
		- b) Go to a restaurant?
- Making choices when confronted by scarcity involves a  **trade-off**

#### Distinguish between microeconomics and macroeconomics
- **Macro**economics deals with the economic problem from society's point of view
	- It is concerned with the performance of the whole economy
- **Micro**economics deals with economics from an individual point of view - referring to a small perspective

#### Describe the economic decision-making process

#### Discuss the importance of economic models
- A **simplified** representation of economic reality showing the relationship between certain economic variables
	- Not inclusive of all detailed; simplified to show key correlations
- It is assumed that people have **rational self-interest** - that economic decisions are based on a person following a logical process
	- Rationality is determined as benefit exceeding cost
	- Price is useful for measuring both

###### Positive and Normative
- Beside developing models, **developing theory is known as positive economics** - 'what is' in the economy
- On the other hand, normative economics is the domain of 'what should be' - largely opinionated
	- Normative statements involve a **value judgement** - an opinion that one situation is preferable above another

#### Demonstrate and explain the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) Model
- Used to visualise the opportunity cost of producing one good/service over another. **BEP** is best demonstrated with a PPF. There are three main assumptions;
	- Resources are fixed
	- Technology is fixed
	- Economy produces only 2 goods
- Each axis are goods
	- Bowed out curve (realistic)
	- Straight curve (constant opportunity cost)
	- Inside curve - inefficient points
	- Outside - unattainable points
	- On curve - efficient and attainable
	- Curve can shift if technology or resources change

#### Discuss the characteristics of a market economy
- Solves the BEP in a network of separate but interconnected markets
- **Markets have;**
	- Buyers (create demand)
	- Sellers (create supply)
	- A commodity (that is bought or sold)
	- Voluntary exchange (between buyers and sellers)
	- A process, mechanics or arrangement through which buyers and sellers 'meet'
	- Price (dependant on strength of demand and supply)
- Two types;
	- **Product** markets:
		- Demand is created by consumers or households
		- Deal in the buying and selling of goods and services
		- Supply is created by producers and firms
	- **Factor** markets:
		- Deal in the buying and selling of factors of production (Land, Labour, Capital, Enterprise)
		- Demand created by firms
		- Supply created by households

###### Key features of a market economy
- Property rights and private ownership
- Economic freedom (able to choose one's own participation in the economy)
- Self-interest
- Competition
- Moral Hazards (there are consequences of poor decision making)
- Limited role of government (mainly regulatory)

### Demand
#### Define the Law of Demand
#### Explain the relationship between individual and market demand schedules and curves
#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes in price on quantity demanded
#### Discuss the non-price factors affecting demand
#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes in non-price factors on demand

### Supply
#### Define the Law of Supply
#### Explain the relationship between individual and market supply schedules and curves
#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes (in price?) on quantity supplied
#### Discuss the non-price factors affecting supply
#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes in non-price factors on supply

### Equilibrium
#### Outline the concept of market equilibrium
#### Explain the concepts of market clearing, shortages and surpluses
#### Explain the effects of changes in demand and/or supply on market equilibrium, including simultaneous shifts

### Elasticity (PES/D = Price Elasticity of Supply/Demand)
#### Define the concept, and measurement, of PED
#### Explain the determinants of PED
#### Distinguish between goods that are price elastic and inelastic in demand
#### Demonstrate and describe the link between price elasticity of demand and Total Revenue
#### Define the concept of PES
#### Distinguish between goods that are price elastic and inelastic in supply
#### Discuss the application of PED and PES to markets
#### Analyse the importance of PED and PES for business and government, including tax incidence and Price Discrimination

### Market Efficiency
#### Outline the concept of market efficiency in a perfectly competitive market
#### Explain the concepts of consumer surplus, producer surplus, total surplus and deadweight loss
#### Outline the efficiency of market equilibrium i.e. maximising total surplus
#### Discuss how under and overproduction in a market can result in a deadweight loss
#### Demonstrate and explain the effects of a tax and subsidy on a market
#### Demonstrate and explain the effects of a price ceiling and price floor on a market

### Market Failure & Power
#### Define the concept of market failure
#### Outline the characteristics of an imperfectly competitive market
#### Explain the concept and causes of market power
#### Explain how market power can influence market efficiency
#### Discuss the policy options to influence market power, incl. regulation/deregulation and legislation

### Market Failure: Externalities
