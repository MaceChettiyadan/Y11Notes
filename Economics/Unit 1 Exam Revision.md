### Intro to Economics
#### Explain the concept of Economics
- Economics deals with two basic facts.
	- People are faced with **limited resources**
	- People have **unlimited wants**
	- This is the **Basic Economic Problem** (BEP)
		- The BEP is a problem of both [[#Scarcity]] and choice
		- To formalise, 'Economics is the study of how people allocate their limited resources to satisfy their unlimited wans - the study of the economic problem, which is one of scarcity and choice.' #testanswer
- To **solve the BEP**, three basic questions should be answered;
	- What to produce?
	- How to produce?
	- For whom to produce?
- In doing so, economics is a **social science**
- Wants are unlimited, recurring, complimentary (iPhone -> Air pods), specific to a person, location and time, and have varying levels of importance

###### Scarcity
- Anything that has a **price** is **scarce**.
	- **Free goods** are those that are not relatively scarce and do not have a price (for example, air breathed)
- It is important to not confuse scarcity with a shortage
	- A shortage occurs when the supply of something is limited
	- Scarcity is the fundamental issue of infinite wants

###### Choice
- Because of scarcity - because of the limited resources, **we must choose between one option or the other**
	- For example, I have the limited amount of $15 - do i
		- a) Go to the movies or   
		- b) Go to a restaurant?
- Making choices when confronted by scarcity involves a  **trade-off**

#### Distinguish between microeconomics and macroeconomics
- **Macro**economics deals with the economic problem from society's point of view
	- It is concerned with the performance of the whole economy
- **Micro**economics deals with economics from an individual point of view - referring to a small perspective

#### Describe the economic decision-making process

#### Discuss the importance of economic models
- A **simplified** representation of economic reality showing the relationship between certain economic variables
	- Not inclusive of all detailed; simplified to show key correlations
- It is assumed that people have **rational self-interest** - that economic decisions are based on a person following a logical process
	- Rationality is determined as benefit exceeding cost
	- Price is useful for measuring both

###### Positive and Normative
- Beside developing models, **developing theory is known as positive economics** - 'what is' in the economy
- On the other hand, normative economics is the domain of 'what should be' - largely opinionated
	- Normative statements involve a **value judgement** - an opinion that one situation is preferable above another

#### Demonstrate and explain the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) Model
- Used to visualise the opportunity cost of producing one good/service over another. **BEP** is best demonstrated with a PPF. There are three main assumptions;
	- Resources are fixed
	- Technology is fixed
	- Economy produces only 2 goods
- Each axis are goods
	- Bowed out curve (realistic)
	- Straight curve (constant opportunity cost)
	- Inside curve - inefficient points
	- Outside - unattainable points
	- On curve - efficient and attainable
	- Curve can shift if technology or resources change

#### Discuss the characteristics of a market economy
- Solves the BEP in a network of separate but interconnected markets
- **Markets have;**
	- Buyers (create demand)
	- Sellers (create supply)
	- A commodity (that is bought or sold)
	- Voluntary exchange (between buyers and sellers)
	- A process, mechanics or arrangement through which buyers and sellers 'meet'
	- Price (dependant on strength of demand and supply)
- Two types;
	- **Product** markets:
		- Demand is created by consumers or households
		- Deal in the buying and selling of goods and services
		- Supply is created by producers and firms
	- **Factor** markets:
		- Deal in the buying and selling of factors of production (Land, Labour, Capital, Enterprise)
		- Demand created by firms
		- Supply created by households

###### Key features of a market economy
- Property rights and private ownership
- Economic freedom (able to choose one's own participation in the economy)
- Self-interest
- Competition
- Moral Hazards (there are consequences of poor decision making)
- Limited role of government (mainly regulatory)

### Demand
#### Define the Law of Demand
- There is an inverse relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded, due to; #testanswer 
	- **Substitution** effect - when a product increases in price, consumers substitute for a cheaper good
	- **Income** effect - when a product becomes more expensive, it takes up a larger portion of a consumers' income and so the consumer has less to spend on other goods
		- The **purchasing power** of income is reduced

#### Explain the relationship between individual and market demand schedules and curves
- The **demand curve** is downward sloping, labelled 'D'. X-axis is labelled as quantity, and the Y-axis as price.
- The **individual demand curve** is;
	- The demand curve for an individual consumer
- The **market demand curve** is;
	- The curve obtained from the horizontal summation of individual demand curves (i.e the average basically)

#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes in price on quantity demanded
- **Movement** - a movement *along* the curve occurs when there is a **price change** (increase/decrease)
	- Expansion in demand = decrease in price
	- Contraction in demand = increase in price
	- Label points $P_{1,}D_1$ and $P_2,D_2$, etc.

#### Discuss the non-price factors affecting demand
- **Non-Price Factors**,
	- ***T*astes and preference** (changes in taste and preference towards a product)
	- ***E*xpectations of consumers** - consumers may **decrease** consumption $\rightarrow$ **demand** if they are **expecting prices to fall**
	- ***P*rice of related** - two relationships
		- **Substitutes** - for example, green to red apples - if the **price** of a **substitute good increases**, the **demand** of the good **increases** (relatively cheaper)
		- **Complements** - if the **price** of a **complementary good increases**, the **demand** of the good **decreases** as the two products tend to be purchased together - for example, phones and phone cases
	- ***I*ncome** (specifically level of *disposable* income)
		- **Normal** goods - As **income increases**, **demand increases** (common sense)
		- **Inferior** goods - goods of lower quality - as **income increases**, people move towards **higher quality substitutes** away from the inferior goods, leading to a **decrease** in **demand** 
	- ***D*emographic factors** - anything such as age, gender, socioeconomic factors - e.g. an aging population will demand more aged care services
	- Acronym is **TEPID**

#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes in non-price factors on demand
- **Shift** - the quantity demanded of the good changes at every price due to **non-price** factors
	- Rightward shift = increase in demand
	- Leftward shift = decrease in demand
	- Label curves $D_{1},D_2,...$, shift is diagonal
- For shifts, you must write at the end *at every single price point* #testanswer 

### Supply
#### Define the Law of Supply
- In most cases, there is a **positive relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied** of that good #testanswer 
	- At **higher prices**, suppliers are willing to produce more as it means they can **earn more profit**

#### Explain the relationship between individual and market supply schedules and curves
- **Market Supply Curve**
	- The curve obtained from the horizontal summation of individual supply curves
- **Individual Supply Curve**
	- A supply curve relating to an individual producer

#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes (in price?) on quantity supplied
- Price can have either a **contractionary** or **expansionary** effect on the supply curve
	- This is a **movement** along the existing supply curve
	- **Expansions** are an increase in price
	- **Contractions** are a decrease in price

#### Discuss the non-price factors affecting supply
 **Expectations of Producers**
		- This is like expected future prices; expected price changes cause suppliers to alter current supply to take advantage of future prices
- **Technology**
	- Improvement in technology can reduce production costs, allowing suppliers to produce more at a lower cost
	- Increase in supply is show as a rightward shift of the supply curve
- **Prices of other goods**
	- If the price of a related good increases, the supplier can shift production to increase the quantity supplied of the related good
- **Input prices**
	- Production costs - if the input prices go down, supply can increase
	- If input prices go up, supply decreases
- **Government Regulation**
	- Government regulations influence the number of suppliers in the market, which increases or decreases market supply
	- Government regulations can take the form of
		- Taxes
		- Tariffs
		- Subsidies
		- Quotas

#### Demonstrate and explain the effect of changes in non-price factors on supply
- This has **shift** effect on the curve, where quantity produced changes at every price point
	- Rightward shifts $\rightarrow$ **increase** in supply
	- Leftward shift $\rightarrow$ **decrease** in supply

### Equilibrium
#### Outline the concept of market equilibrium
- **Equilibrium Price** is the price that clears the market, where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied
	- Changes in the market result in temporary surpluses or shortages which then cause price to change to reach new equilibrium
- Occurs through the **price mechanism**
	- This is the process by which the forces of demand and supply interact to determine the price of a good or service $\rightarrow$ helps to clear shortages and surpluses within the market
- **Adam Smith's Invisible Hand** theory relates to the unobservable market force that helps the demand and supply of goods in a free market to reach equilibrium automatically
	- Enabling people to trade freely

#### Explain the concepts of market clearing, shortages and surpluses
A **shortage** is where quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied
	- Consumers **bid** among themselves for the limited goods so the price of the good increases
	- In the diagram below, we can see that at $P_2$, Quantity supplied is much lower than demanded, so there is a shortage, away from the eqauilibrium of Pe. **One thing missing from the diagram:** the area of shortage should be indicated
		- For this **market to clear**, for equilibrium to be achieved again, *Consumers will bid amongst themselves for the limited supply, increasing the price and leading to a contractionary movement along the demand curve. Because of this, there will be an expansionary movement along the supply curve, achieving market equilibrium again.* #testanswer 

![[ShortageDiagramEcon.png|400]]

- **On the other hand,** surplus is when the quantity supplies exceeds the quantity demanded
	- Firms lower their prices to clear **excess stock**. The same as the above diagram, but the surplus is above the equilibrium
	- For this **market to clear**, *Suppliers will lower their prices in order to sell excess stock, leading to a contractionary movement along the supply curve. Due to these lowered prices, there will be increased demand - an expansionary movement along the demand curve. Together, these movements will achieve market equilibrium.* #testanswer 
- **Both surplus and shortages** occur because prices are either below or above $P_e$. (below for shortage, above for surplus)

#### Explain the effects of changes in demand and/or supply on market equilibrium, including simultaneous shifts
- When there is a **one-way** shift in demand/supply there will be a **temporary shortage** or **temporary surplus**
	- The market will clear, however
	- **To explain a one-way shift** #testanswer 
		1. Identify the non-price factor
		2. Does it lead to an increase/decrease - rightward or leftward shift
		3. At original price, compare quantity demanded and supplied of new curve
		4. Identify temporary shortage/surplus
		5. Action taken to clear the market - by the consumers, or the producers
		6. Expansion/contraction in demand and supply curves
		7. The new equilibrium, comparing it to the original
- When there is a **simultaneous** shift, things get a bit goofy.
	- One of the values will always be indeterminate.
		- For example, Inc. Supply and Dec. Demand: inc. supply will push price down and quantity up, dec. demand will push price down and quantity down.
			- Therefore, quantity is indeterminate (it is being stretched up and down!)
			- There is a decrease in supply.

### Elasticity (PES/D = Price Elasticity of Supply/Demand)
#### Define the concept, and measurement, of PED
**Price elasticity of demand** measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price #testanswer 
	- Can be calculated by Percentage Change (Point Method 1) - $$Ed = \frac{\%change \space in \space quantity \space demanded}{\% change \space in \space price}$$
		- Also, the Midpoint Method - $$\frac{(Q_2-Q_1)/[(Q_2+Q_1)/2]}{(P_2-P_1)/[(P_2+P_1)/2]}$$
		- Point Method 2 $$\frac{\triangle Q}{Q}\times \frac{P}{\triangle P}$$

#### Explain the determinants of PED
- There are **five main** determinants/factors of **PED**
	- **The availability of *substitutes*** - if there are substitutes available, a good would be much more elastic
	- **Whether the good is a *necessity* or a *luxury*** - necessities would be inelastic, while luxuries would be elastic
	- **Proportion of income spent** - cheaper goods tend to be inelastic and unresponsive to price change, so higher income spent $\rightarrow$ more elastic
	- **Time period considered** - the more time to **react** to a price change, the more elastic a good gets. For example, for petrol, if the price increases you will likely immediately still need petrol, but in time you could change to other substitutes
	- **The definition of the market** - Narrower categories (fruits $\rightarrow$ bananas) produce more substitutes, and in this example there are many types of fruits. Narrower markets are more responsive.
#### Distinguish between goods that are price elastic and inelastic in demand
#### Demonstrate and describe the link between price elasticity of demand and Total Revenue
#### Define the concept of PES
#### Distinguish between goods that are price elastic and inelastic in supply
#### Discuss the application of PED and PES to markets
#### Analyse the importance of PED and PES for business and government, including tax incidence and Price Discrimination

### Market Efficiency
#### Outline the concept of market efficiency in a perfectly competitive market
#### Explain the concepts of consumer surplus, producer surplus, total surplus and deadweight loss
#### Outline the efficiency of market equilibrium i.e. maximising total surplus
#### Discuss how under and overproduction in a market can result in a deadweight loss
#### Demonstrate and explain the effects of a tax and subsidy on a market
#### Demonstrate and explain the effects of a price ceiling and price floor on a market

### Market Failure & Power
#### Define the concept of market failure
#### Outline the characteristics of an imperfectly competitive market
#### Explain the concept and causes of market power
#### Explain how market power can influence market efficiency
#### Discuss the policy options to influence market power, incl. regulation/deregulation and legislation
