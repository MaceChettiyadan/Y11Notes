#### Outline the classification of goods
- **Two types**
	- **Rival** - does the consumption by one party reduce the supply available for another
	- **Excludable** - is it possible to exclude a non-payer from the good or service
- There are [[#Private Goods]], [[#Club Goods]], [[#Common Property Resources]] and [[#Public Goods]]

##### Private Goods
- Are **rival** *and* **excludable**
	- for example, clothing, food.

##### Club Goods
- Are **non-rival** *and* **excludable**
	- Gyms, Concerts

##### Merit & Demerit Goods
###### Merit Goods
- Goods that are produced that have large external benefits for society
	- Goods that will be underprovided in the economy if the product is left in the market
###### Demerit Goods
- Goods that are produced that have large external costs for society
	- Goods that will be overprovided if left in the market
- Are private goods as they are both rivary and exclusive

#### Describe the public goods and the free rider effect
##### Public Goods
- **Non-rival** *and* **Non-excludable**
	- E.g. national parks, lighthouses, national defence

##### Free rider effect
- Public goods cause the free rider effect
- Free riders enjoy the benefits of the consumption of a resource without paying for the cost of provision
- This can lead to over-consumption and rapid damage of a public resource

#### Describe common resources and the tragedy of commons
##### Common Property Resources
- Are **rival** *and* **non-excludable**
	- Fish in the ocean

##### Tragedy of Commons
- Common Property Resources lead to tragedy of commons
- Refers to the over-consumption of common property resources, e.g. over-fishing
- Occurs as the resource is readily available and there are no restrictions on consumption
- However, once consumed the resource is not availble to any other party, leading to depletion of the resource.

#### Discuss the policy options to reduce market failure associated with [[#Public Goods]] and [[#Common Property Resources]]
- **Common Property Goods**: Enforce restrictions on consumption - e.g. fishing limits, no-fishing xones, fishing licenses, etc.
- **Public Goods**: Create ownership of the resource, e.g. fees for public transport, fines for damaging public property
