#### The Modified Market Economy
- Will allocate resources efficiently, but not necessarily fairly (equitably)
- This creates **modified market economies** (which have some level of government intervention)
	- For example, Australia
- The economic roles of government in such an economy can be categorised as
	- The provision of public goods and services
	- The redistribution of income
	- The regulation of business enterprises
	- Macroeconomic management


#### Provision of goods and services
- People pay for private goods out of their own pockets
- However, **electricity, gas, water, etc**. are **provided by government for the following reasons:**
	- They require large amounts of **expensive** infrastructure
	- To prevent monopolisation and exploitation
	- they are **natural monopolies** (can take advantage of monopolies of scale, centralisation)
- This has changed over time, through a process known as <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">privatization</mark>
