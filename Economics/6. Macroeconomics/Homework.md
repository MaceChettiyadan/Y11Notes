#### Macroeconomics
- Allows us to interpret articles by the media
- Allows us to develop economic literacy

#### Models
- A simplified view of reality that omits many of the complications of the real world in order to provide us with a clear picture of how something works
- The **circular flow of income** is a macroeconomic model that describes flows of resources, goods and services between the parts of the economy
	- It divides the economy into its key sectors - households, firms, the financial sector, the government and overseas sector

##### Households and Firms
- We assume;
	- There are only two sectors - households and firms
	- Households are the owners of the productive resources and the buyer of final goods and services
	- Households spend *all* their income with no saving
- There exist *real* flows and *money* flows
- Reminds us that markets are interdependent
	- Product Market and Factor Market

##### Saving and Investment
- Relax assumption that households spend all their income with no saving
- The financial markets such as banks, credit unions and super funds make up the **capital/finance** market
	- Saving represents a leakage from the model
	- Investment is defined as a expenditure of firms on production equipment and machinery

##### The Government Sector
- Produces goods and services such as healthcare, education, welfare services and defence
	- This is by purchasing products in the factor market; this is why gov. spending is an injection into firms
	- Things such as welfare allowances are called **transfer payments** because they are provided without exchange of goods and services in return

##### Overseas Sector
- All households spend some of their income on goods and services imported from overseas.
	- We relax the assumption that the economy is closed as we export and import through leakages and injections

#### Equilibrium
- 'One man's spending is another mans income'.
- $\Sigma O = \Sigma Y = \Sigma E$
	- (output, income and expenditure respectively)
	- This is known as equilibrium
