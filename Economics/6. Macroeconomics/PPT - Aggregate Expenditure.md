## Aggregate Expenditure
- Statisticians and economists develop accounting systems based on the circular flow
- Measured using <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">GDP</mark>
	- **Expenditure Approach:** addition of all final expenditures within a country given a period of time
	- **National income Approach:** addition of all income earned from factors of production that produce goods and services given a period of time
	- **Output approach**: addition of all value of goods and services produced in a country given a period of time
- AE is
	- *the total amount that firms, households and government plan to spend on final goods and services at each level of income*
	- Calculated as $AE=C+I+G+(X-M)$
	- Is also the expenditure method of calculating GDP

#### Consumption
- $C$ - Household expenditure on durable goods, non-durable goods and services
	- **Durables** last over 3 years
	- **Non-durables** last less than three years
	- **Services** are non-commodity items
	- **Autonomous** vs **discretionary**
		- Discretionary - change spending based on level of income - higher quality
- Approximately $58\%$ of AG.
- **Factors affecting consumption include**
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Disposable income</mark> - an increase would lead to an increase in expenditure - higher purchasing power
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Interest rates</mark> - If interest rates go up, people prefer to save over spending
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Availability of credit</mark> - the more credit, the more people take out money and spend it
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Stock of personal wealth</mark> - self-explanatory
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Expectations</mark> - expectations of *the whole economy*, measured in economic downturn, recession, upswing
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Government Policies</mark>
		- **Fiscal** - if people get more money, the economy does well, you are likely to spend more money
		- **Monetary** - the ***cash rate*

#### Investment
- $I$ - Expenditure on producer or capital goods that are used to produce final goods and services in the future
- Investment by private firms
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Fixed investment</mark> (usually on capital goods)
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Residential fixed investment</mark> (private expenditure on new housing)
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Changes in business inventories</mark> (stocks of goods that have been produced but not yet sold)
- Approximately $18\%$ of AG
- **Factors affecting investment include**
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Rate of interest</mark>
		- **Nominal** - does nor account for inflation
		- **Real** - accounts for inflation
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Business Expectations</mark>
		- Decrease/increase investment based on how businesses expect the economy to behave in the future
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Level of past profits</mark>
		- Like expectations
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Government policies</mark>
		- Fiscal & Monetary once again

#### Government
- $G$ - government expenditure on ***all*** the levels of government
- 2 parts:
	- $G1$: current government expenditure on day to day functions - rent on offices
	- $G2:$ investment and expenditure on future needs e.g. schools and roads
- Approximately $24\%$ of AG
- **Factors affecting government expenditure include**
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Government policy objectives</mark>
		- e.g. policy to make the peoples smart - education $\rightarrow$ would lead to more schools being built
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Current economic climate</mark>
		- Decrease expenditure during high inflation, etc. 

#### Net Exports
- $X-M$ - Value of exports minus value of imports
- **Factors affecting net exports include**
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Exchange rate</mark>
		- If the dollar appreciates, imports become cheaper and exports become more expensive, in net leasing to less **net exports** and thus **less AE**
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Domestic and overseas economic activity</mark>
		- If domestic activity increases then imports will increase (capital)
		- If overseas activity increases then exports will increase (their capital)
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Tariffs and Quotas</mark>
		- If a foreign economy places a tariff on exports, net exports would decrease
		- Quotas are limitations
