### Supply
- **Supply** is the amount of goods or services that producers are **willing** and **able** to sell at each **price** point at a particular **point in time** #testanswer 

###### The law of supply
- In most cases, there is a **positive relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied** of that good #testanswer 
	- At **higher prices**, suppliers are willing to produce more as it means they can **earn more profit**

###### The relationship between individual and market supply schedules/curve factors
- **Market Supply Curve**
	- The curve obtained from the horizontal summation of individual supply curves
- **Individual Supply Curve**
	- A supply curve relating to an individual producer

###### The effect of changes in price on quantity supplied
- Price can have either a **contractionary** or **expansionary** effect on the supply curve
	- This ia a **movement** along the existing supply curve
	- **Expansions** are an increase in price
	- **Contractions** are a decrease in price

###### The effect of changes in non-price factors on quantity supplied
- This has **shift** effect on the curve, where quantity produced changes at every price point
	- Rightward shifts $\rightarrow$ **increase** in supply
	- Leftward shift $\rightarrow$ **decrease** in supply
- There are many **examples that must be known**
	- **Expectations of Producers**
		- This is like expected future prices; expected price changes cause suppliers to alter current supply to take advantage of future prices
	- **Technology**
		- Improvement in technology can reduce production costs, allowing suppliers to produce more at a lower cost
		- Increase in supply is show as a righward shift of the supply curve
	- **Prices of other goods**
		- If the price of a related good increases, the supplier can shift production to increase the quantity supplied of the related good
	- **Input prices**
		- Production costs - if the input prices go down, supply can increase
		- If input prices go up, supply decreases
	- **Government Regulation**
		- Government regulations influence the number of suppliers in the market, which increases or decreases market supply
		- Government regulations can take the form of
			- Taxes
			- Tariffs
			- Subsidies
			- Quotas

### Example
##### The car market
- Government regulation (luxury car tax) $\rightarrow$ decrease in supply, shifting the supply curve from $S$ to $S_2$ at every price point (this is an ideal #testanswer )
- Input prices (steel price increases) $\rightarrow$ decrease in supply
- Technology (better manufacturing) $\rightarrow$ increase in supply

### Questions
1. Crude oil prices fell below $\$100$ a barrel. This led to unleaded petrol prices to faling $4.6c$ 
2. Two non price factors are;
	1. Input prices - the fact that crude oil price decreased directly correlated to unleaded petrol prices
	2. Government regulation - decreasing taxes could increase supply, shifting the curve to the right.
3. An increase - this would shift the curve to the right, allowing suppliers to produce more supply at the same price point
4. For fresh vegetables, petrol is a massive input price, and therefore a non-price factor. A decrease in such an input price would increase supply in the market and allow vegetables to get cheaper. Below, we can see that at Q1, after the shift to the right due to a change in petrol prices, prices for vegetables decreases.
