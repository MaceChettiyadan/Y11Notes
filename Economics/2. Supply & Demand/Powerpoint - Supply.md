### Supply
- **Supply** is the amount of goods or services that producers are **willing** and **able** to sell at each **price** point at a particular **point in time** #testanswer 

###### The law of supply
- In most cases, there is a **positive relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied** of that good #testanswer 
	- At **higher prices**, suppliers are willing to produce more as it means they can **earn more profit**

###### The relationship between individual and market supply schedules/curve factors
- **Market Supply Curve**
	- The curve obtained from the horizontal summation of individual supply curves
- **Individual Supply Curve**
	- A supply curve relating to an individual producer

###### The effect of changes in price on quantity supplied
- Price can have either a **contractionary** or **expansionary** effect on the supply curve
	- This ia a **movement** along the existing supply curve
	- **Expansions** are an increase in price
	- **Contractions** are a decrease in price

###### The effect of changes in non-price factors on quantity supplied
- This has **shift** effect on the curve, where quantity produced changes at every price point
	- Rightward shifts $\rightarrow$ **increase** in supply
	- Leftward shift $\rightarrow$ **decrease** in supply
- There are many **examples that must be known**
	- **Expectations of Producers**
		- This is like expected future prices; expected price changes cause suppliers to alter current supply to take advantage of future prices
	- **Technology**
		- Improvement in technology can reduce production costs, allowing suppliers to produce more at a lower cost
		- Increase in supply is show as a righward shift of the supply curve
	- **Prices of other goods**
		- If the price of a related good increases, the supplier can shift production to increase the quantity supplied of the related good
	- **Input prices**
		- Production costs - if the input prices go down, supply can increase
		- If input prices go up, supply decreases
	- **Government Regulation**
		- Government regulations influence the number of suppliers in the market, which increases or decreases market supply
		- Government regulations can take the form of
			- Taxes
			- Tariffs
			- Subsidies
			- Quotas


### Examples
##### The car market
- Government regulation (luxury car tax) $\rightarrow$ decrease in supply
- Input prices (steel price increases) $\rightarrow$ decrease in supply
- Technology (better manufacturing) $\rightarrow$ increase in supply
