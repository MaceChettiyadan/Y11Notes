# Summary Notes - CH2
#### The Role of Markets
- Economic systems exist to deal with the economic problem, in order to answer the basic economic problem ([[Economics/1. Introduction/Homework]])
- A **market** is said to exist when buyers and sellers exchange goods, services or resources. A market consists of three elements
	- Buyers $\rightarrow$ Create Demand
	- Sellers $\rightarrow$ Create Supply
	- Something to exchange (goods & services)
- Markets must be voluntary exchange
- There exist [[#Competitive Markets]] and [[#Imperfect Market]]
- In the market system, the key economic questions are answered by the **price mechanism**
	- The consumer is king (consumer sovereingty), and they determine the answers to the BEP questions.
	- Markets are guided by self-interest on both the supply and demand side

###### Competitive Markets
- Characterised by;
	- A large number of buyers and sellers
	- Firms being price takers
	- Homogenous products
	- Easy entry into market (no barriers)

###### Imperfect Markets
- Characterised by;
	- A small number of firms
	- Product differentiation
	- Firms being price setters
	- Restricted entry into market
- An **extreme imperfect market** is a monopoly market, where the market is centered around one fir,.
	- An oligopoly is a market with a few dominant firms


#### Demand Side
- Demand refers to the buying intentions of customers.
	- This is not a want; wants are desired but demands are desires characterised by an ability to actually buy.
	- Demand is governed by the law of demand, which is discussed in the [[Powerpoint - Demand#The law of demand]].
		- **Income effect** - higher income $\rightarrow$ more purchasing power
		- **Substitution effect** - when the price of a substitute increases, the price of the good increases as it becomes more attractive to buyers.
		- The effects hold true always, as long as all other factors are constant

###### Changes in the Demand Curve
- There are two changes
	- **Shifts** - a shift of the whole curve left or right (a decrease or increase) caused by a **non-price factor**
		- These factors are listed in [[Powerpoint - Demand#The effect of changes in non-price factors on quantity demanded]]
	- **Movements** - a movement along the curve caused by a **change in price**

#### Supply Side
- Represents the sellres or producers side of the market.
	- More is on [[Powerpoint - Supply#The law of supply]]
- Rational, self-interested suppliers prefer to sell their output at a higher price than a lower one in order to maximise gain
- Below, a supply curve is charted.

###### Changes in the Supply Curve
- There are once again two changes
	- **Shifts** - a shift of the whole curve left or right (a decrease or increase) caused by a **non-price factor**
		- These factors are listed in [[Powerpoint - Supply#The effect of changes in non-price factors on quantity supplied]]
	- **Movements** - a movement along the curve caused by a **change in price**


#### Equilibrium
- If we graph supply & demand on the same curve we can draw the equilibrium quantity and price as the points where the **two curves intersect**
	- Balances buying intentions of customer with selling intentions of supplier
- If **the price is below the equilibrium**, there will be a **shortage**, and a **surplus** above.

###### Shifts
- When there are shifts in either curve, the equilbrium will change. In order for there not to be a surplus or shortage, the price will naturally increase or decrease by
	- **Suppliers selling excess stock** at a **lower price**
	- **Customers bidding up the price** due to lack of supply
- In the time this takes to happen, there will be a temporary shortage or surplus

###### Simultaneous Shifts
- What if both the **demand** *and* **supply** curves shifted at the same time?
- They could have different effects, detailed in the table below

| **Type of Shift**           | **Effect on Price ** | **Effect on Quantity** | (Temporary) **Shortage or Surplus?** |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| $\uparrow D$                | Increase             | Increase               | Shortage                             |
| $\downarrow D$              | Decrease             | Decrease               | Surplus                              |
| $\uparrow S$                | Decrease             | Increase               | Surplus                              |
| $\downarrow S$              | Increase             | Decrease               | Shortage                             |
| $\uparrow D \uparrow S$     | Indeterminate        | Increase               | N/A                                  |
| $\uparrow D \downarrow S$   | Increase             | Indeterminate          | Shortage                             |
| $\downarrow D \uparrow S$   | Decrease             | Indeterminate          | Surplus                              |
| $\downarrow D \downarrow S$ | Indeterminate        | Decrease               | N/A                                     |
- We can observe **indeterminate** values for the simultaneous shifts; these depend on the **magnitude of the shift**
	- Could increase, decrease, or stay the same
