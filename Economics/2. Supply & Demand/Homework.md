# Summary Notes - CH2
#### The Role of Markets
- Economic systems exist to deal with the economic problem, in order to answer the basic economic problem ([[Economics/1. Introduction/Homework]])
- A **market** is said to exist when buyers and sellers exchange goods, services or resources. A market consists of three elements
	- Buyers $\rightarrow$ Create Demand
	- Sellers $\rightarrow$ Create Supply
	- Something to exchange (goods & services)
- Markets must be voluntary exchange
- There exist [[#Competitive Markets]] and [[#Imperfect Market]]
- In the market system, the key economic questions are answered by the **price mechanism**
	- The consumer is king (consumer sovereingty), and they determine the answers to the BEP questions.
	- Markets are guided by self-interest on both the supply and demand side

###### Competitive Markets
- Characterised by;
	- A large number of buyers and sellers
	- Firms being price takers
	- Homogenous products
	- Easy entry into market (no barriers)

###### Imperfect Markets
- Characterised by;
	- A small number of firms
	- Product differentiation
	- Firms being price setters
	- Restricted entry into market
- An **extreme imperfect market** is a monopoly market, where the market is centered around one fir,.
	- An oligopoly is a market with a few dominant firms


#### Demand Side
- Demand refers to the buying intentions of customers.
	- This is not a want; wants are desired but demands are desires characterised by an ability to actually buy.
	- Demand is governed by the law of demand, which is discussed in the [[Powerpoint - Demand]].
		- **Income effect** - higher income $\rightarrow$ more purchasing power
		- **Substitution effect** - when the price of a substitute increases, the price of the good increases as it becomes more attractive to buyers.
		- The effects hold true always, as long as all other factors are constant
