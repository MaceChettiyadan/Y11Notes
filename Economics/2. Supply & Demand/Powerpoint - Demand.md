### Demand
- **Demand** is the quantity of a good or service that consumers are **willing** and **able** to buy at each **price** in a particular point in **time** #testanswer 

###### The law of demand
- There is an inverse relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded, due to; #testanswer 
	- **Substitution** effect - when a product increases in price, consumers subsititute for a cheaper good
	- **Income** effect - when a product becomes more expensive, it takes up a larger portion of a consumers' income and so the consumer has less to spend on other goods
		- The **purchasing power** of income is reduced

###### The relationship between indvidual and market demand schedules and curves
- The **demand curve** is downward sloping, labelled 'D'. X-axis is labelled as quantity, and the Y-axis as price.
- The **individual demand curve** is;
	- The demand curve for an individual consumer
- The **market demand curve** is;
	- The curve obtained from the horizontal summation of individual demand curves (i.e the average basically)

###### Factors impacting demand
- Price and non-price
###### The effect of changes in price on quantity demanded
- **Movement** - a movement *along* the curve occurs when there is a **price change** (increase/decrease)
	- Expansion in demand = decrease in price
	- Contraction in demand = increase in price
	- Label points $P_{1,}D_1$ and $P_2,D_2$, etc.

###### The effect of changes in non-price factors on quantity demanded
- **Shift** - the quantity demanded of the good changes at every price due to **non-price** factors
	- Rightward shift = increase in demand
	- Leftward shift = decrease in demand
	- Label curves $D_{1},D_2,...$, shift is diagonal
- **Examples** that **MUST be remembered** are,
	- ***T*astes and preference** (changes in taste and preference towards a product)
	- ***E*xpectations of consumers** - consumers may **decrease** consumption $\rightarrow$ **demand** if they are **expecting prices to fall**
	- ***P*rice of related** - two relationships
		- **Substitutes** - for example, green to red apples - if the **price** of a **substitute good increases**, the **demand** of the good **increases** (relatively cheaper)
		- **Complements** - if the **price** of a **complementary good increases**, the **demand** of the good **decreases** as the two products tend to be purchased together - for example, phones and phone cases
	- ***I*ncome** (specifically level of *disposable* income)
		- **Normal** goods - As **income increases**, **demand increases** (commonsense)
		- **Inferior** goods - goods of lower quality - as **income increases**, people move towards **higher quality substitutes** away from the inferior goods, leading to a **decrease** in **demand** 
	- ***D*emographic factors** - anything such as age, gender, socioeconomic factors - e.g. an aging population will demand more aged care services
	- Acronym is **TEPID**
- For shifts, you must write at the end *at every single price point* #testanswer
