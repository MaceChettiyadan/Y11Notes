### Equlibrium
- **Equilibrium** is the state of the market where there is no tendency for either demand or supply to change - i.e quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied #testanswer 

###### Outline the concept of market equilibrium
- **Equilibrium Price** is the price that clears the market, where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied
	- Changes in the market result in temporary surpluses or shortages which then cause price to change to reach new equilibrium
- Occurs through the **price mechanism**
	- This is the process by which the forces of demand and supply interact to determine the price of a good or service $\rightarrow$ helps to clear shortages and surpluses within the market
- **Adam Smith's Invisible Hand** theory relates to the unobservable market force that helps the demand and supply of goods in a free market to reach equilibrium automatically
	- Enabling people to trade freely

###### Explain the concepts of market clearing, shortages and surpluses
- A **shortage** is where quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied
	- Consumers **bid** among themselves for the limited goods so the price of the good increases
	- In the diagram below, we can see that at $P_2$, Quantity supplied is much lower than demanded, so there is a shortage, away from the eqauilibrium of Pe. **One thing missing from the diagram:** the area of shortage should be indicated
		- For this **market to clear**, for equilibrium to be achieved again, *Consumers will bid amongst themselves for the limited demand, increasing the price and leading to a contractionary movement along the demand curve. Because of this, there will be an expansionary movement along the supply curve, achieving market equilibrium again.* #testanswer

- **On the other hand,** surplus is when the quantity supplies exceeds the quantity demanded
	- Firms lower their prices to clear **excess stock**. The same as the above diagram, but the surplus is above the equilibrium
	- For this **market to clear**, *Suppliers will lower their prices in order to sell excess stock, leading to a contractionary movement along the supply curve. Due to these lowered prices, there will be increased demand - an expansionary movement along the demand curve. Together, these movements will achieve market equilibrium.* #testanswer 
- **Both surplus and shortages** occur because prices are either below or above $P_e$. (below for shortage, above for surplus)

###### Explain the effects of changes in demand and/or supply on market equilibrium, including simultaneous shifts of demand and supply
