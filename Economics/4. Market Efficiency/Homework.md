#### Outline the concept of market efficiency in a perfectly competitive market
- **Efficiency** means producing the goods that society wants at the lowest possible cost.
	- An efficient outcome means that it is not possible to make someone better off without making someone worse off

#### Explain the concepts of consumer surplus, producer surplus, total surplus and deadweight loss
###### Consumer Surplus
- The **demand curve** is a willingness to pay curve - it reflects the maximum price a consumer is prepared to pay for a particular good.
- The difference between what the consumer is *prepared to pay* and what they *actually pay* is the **consumer surplus** ($CS$)
- In the demand curve, below the equilibrium is consumer expenditure, and above is consumer surplus.
	- At its core, consumer surplus is a measure of the economic wel l-being for consumers.

###### Producer Surplus
- The **supply curve** reflects the minimum price that producers are willing to sell their products
- Then, the difference between *what a producer is willing to receive* and what they *actually receive* is **producer surplus** ($PS$)
- In the supply curve, producer surplus is above the curve and below the equilibrium, and cost of production is below the curve
	- At its core, if producer surplus rises in a market, then this indicates that producers are happier

###### Total Surplus
- **Total Surplus** is the measure of the net benefits to society from the production and consumption of a good. It is equated $TS = PS+CS$
- The aim of society should be to increase $TS$ in every market - it is an extremely important concept because it provides us with a measure of **market efficiency.**

#### Outline the efficiency of market equilibrium i.e. maximising total surplus
- 

#### Discuss how under- and overproduction in a market can result in a deadweight loss
- When $TS$ is reduced because of either under or overproduction, it is referred to as **deadweight loss**
	- A **deadweight loss** refers to an avoidable decrease in $TS$ because something has prevented the market from producing the optimal output. An example could be *monopoly*.
- To minimise $DWL$ is the role of government, though some government policies can reduced economic efficiency, as detailed in the next heading.

#### Demonstrate and explain the effects of a tax and subsidy on a market
- Governments levy **taxes** on goods and services in order to raise revenue for government spending programs.
	- This *decreases* the *supply* curve, shifting it to the *left*
	- In doing so, a DWL is created from the original to the new supply curve, and tax revenue is equal to the magnitude of the shift.
