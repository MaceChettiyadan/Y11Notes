##### Explain the concepts of consumer surplus, producer surplus, total surplus and deadweight loss
- **Efficiency** is the production of goods that society wants at the lowest possible price.
###### The *consumer* surplus ($CS$)
- **Consumer Surplus** is the difference between what a consumer is prepared to pay and what they actually pay in the market #testanswer 
- **Marginal Benefit** is the extra benefit from consuming one extra unit of the good or service
- The demand curve is what the consumer is actually willing and able to pay
- However, they could actually pay something lower; the difference would be the *consumer surplus*

###### The *producer* surplus ($PS$)
- This is related to the amount the producer is *willing* to receive.
	- **Formally**, the difference between what a producer is willing to receive and what they actually receive in a market #testanswer 
	- **Marginal** cost is the extra opportunity cost of producing one more unit of a good or service
- The same concept as consumer surplus; the difference is *producer surplus*
![[ProducerSurplus.svg]]
- ***Combining both diagrams,*** **total surplus** is the measure of the net benefits to society from the production and consumption of the good #testanswer 
	- This is equal to the $PS+CS$
	- **Allocative efficiency** is achieved

##### Discuss how over and underproduction in a market can create deadweight loss ($DWL$)
- **Deadweight loss** is a loss in total surplus that is avoidable #testanswer 
	- The situations we have to deal with are where price is *above* and *below* the equilibrium
	- A diagram for *above*; it is important to note that $PS$ is not a triangle, but instead the area above the supply curve below P1 ![[TSPGreaterthanE.svg]]
	- And another, for *below* ![[TSPLessthanE.svg]]
- **Also,** when *quantity* is *above* and *below* the equilibrium. Dunno if the second one is correct yet. ![[QTYDWL.svg]] ![[QTYDWLb.svg]]

##### Demonstrate and explain the effects of a tax and subsidy on a market
###### Tax
- **Why do governments tax** if it introduces inefficiency?
	- Can aid in the redistribution of income
	- To correct externalities
	- To earn revenue
- **Impact of tax**
	- Reduces quantity while increasing price
	- Tax incidence depends on the elasticity of the good/service
	- Creates a DWL
**To explain either,**
1. Original P/Qty
2. Implement government policy
3. New price/quantity
4. Tax Revenue
5. CS/PS/TS/DWL
6. Conclusion on efficiency

-  **Direct tax**
	- e.g. **income tax**
- **Indirect tax**
	- Consumers do not pay the tax directly, but are affected through changes in the price of the good or service
		- **Specific tax**: the tac is a fixed amount or is a set sum of money per unit
		- **Ad Valorem** tax: Where the tax is a percentage of the value of the diagram, e.g. GST

###### Subsidies
- A payment by the government to a firm to reduce production costs and increase output #testanswer 
- The **aim** is to encourage production of goods with positive externalities
	- Allow the producer to export more
	- Aid expansion of the firm
- **Impact of subsidies**
	- DWL as part of government expenditure on the subsidy is not translated into either consumer of producer surplus
- **Case Study: ***CORN***
	- 

##### Demonstrate and explain the effects of a price ceiling and price floor on a market
###### Price Ceilings
- **Price Ceilings** are the highest price that a producer can charge on a good
- Is usually *below* the equilibrium price
- Intended to keep prices affordable for majority of the population
- **Need for rationing process** to regulate demand, but this could lead to a **black market**
 
###### Price Floors
- **Minimum Price** that a producer can charge on a good
- Is usually *above* the equilibrium price
- Designed to ensure that there is a minimum income received by producers
- However, this could result in *informal illegal markets* where workers are paid less than the minimum wage.

**To explain either,**
1. Original Pe and Qe
2. Implement price ceiling or floor
3. New price and Quantity
4. Compare Qs and Qd $\rightarrow$ shortage/surplus
5. CS/PS/TS/DWL
	- Talk about changes in CS/PS/TS, then talk about loss in efficiency i.e DWL.
