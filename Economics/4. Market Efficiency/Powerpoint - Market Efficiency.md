##### Explain the concepts of consumer surplus, producer surplus, total surplus and deadweight loss
###### The *consumer* surplus ($CS$)
- **Consumer Surplus** is the difference between what a consumer is prepared to pay and what they actually pay in the market #testanswer 
- **Marginal Benefit** is the extra benefit from consuming one extra unit of the good or service
- The demand curve is what the consumer is actually willing and able to pay
- However, they could actually pay something lower; the difference would be the *consumer surplus*

###### The *producer* surplus ($PS$)
- This is related to the amount the producer is *willing* to receive.
	- **Formally**, the difference between what a producer is willing to receive and what they actually receive in a market #testanswer 
	- **Marginal** cost is the extra opportunity cost of producing one more unit of a good or service
- The same concept as consumer surplus; the difference is *producer surplus*

- ***Combining both diagrams,*** **total surplus** is the measure of the net benefits to society from the production and consumption of the good #testanswer 
	- This is equal to the $PS+CS$
	- **Allocative efficiency** is achieved

##### Discuss how over and underproduction in a market can create deadweight loss ($DWL$)
- **Deadweight loss** is a loss in total surplus that is avoidable #testanswer 
	- The situations we have to deal with are where price is *above* and *below* the equilibrium
	- A diagram for *above*; it is important to note that $PS$ is not a triangle, but instead the area above the supply curve below P1 ![[TSPGreaterthanE.svg]]
	- And another, for *below* ![[TSPLessthanE.svg]]
