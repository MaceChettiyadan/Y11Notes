- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Fluctuations</mark> in the growth of real output, consisting of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">alternative periods of expansion and contraction</mark> are called business cycles/economic fluctuations
	- also called **economic cycle** or **trade cycle**
- plots **real gdp** on the vertical axis against **time** on the x axis such that the derivative is real GDP growth
	- **real** because we eliminate price level changes
- we have **peaks, troughs, expansions and contractions**
	- make sure to draw a dotted **long term growth trend**

### Expansion
- Occurs when there is a positive growth in real GDP, shown by parts of the curve that slope upward
- During periods of real GDP growth, **employment of resources increases**, and the **real price levels increase**

### Peak
- A peak represents the cycle's **maximum** real GDP and marks the end of the expansion
- When the economy reaches a peak, **employment of resources has risen substantially**, and the general **price level may be rising quite rapidly**

### Contraction
- Following the peak, the economy begins to experience falling real GDP shown by the downward sloping parts of the curve
- If the contraction lasts six months (two quarters) or more, it is termed a **recession**, characterised by **falling real GDP** and growing unemployment of resources
- **Increases in the price level may slow down a lot**, and it is even possible that prices in some sectors may begin to fall.

### Trough
- Represents the cycle's minimum level of GDP, or the end of the contraction
- There may now be **widespread unemployment**
- A trough is followed by a new period of expansion/recovery, marking the beginning of a new cycle
