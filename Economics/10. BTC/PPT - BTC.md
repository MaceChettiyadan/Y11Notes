- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Fluctuations</mark> in the growth of real output, consisting of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">alternative periods of expansion and contraction</mark> are called business cycles/economic fluctuations
	- also called **economic cycle** or **trade cycle**
- plots **real gdp** on the vertical axis against **time** on the x axis such that the derivative is real GDP growth
	- **real** because we eliminate price level changes
- we have **peaks, troughs, expansions and contractions**
	- make sure to draw a dotted **long term growth trend**

### Expansion
- Occurs when there is a positive growth in real GDP, shown by parts of the curve that slope upward
- During periods of real GDP growth, **employment of resources increases**, and the **real price levels increase**

### Peak
- A peak represents the cycle's **maximum** real GDP and marks the end of the expansion
- When the economy reaches a peak, **employment of resources has risen substantially**, and the general **price level may be rising quite rapidly**

### Contraction
- Following the peak, the economy begins to experience falling real GDP shown by the downward sloping parts of the curve
- If the contraction lasts six months (two quarters) or more, it is termed a **recession**, characterised by **falling real GDP** and growing unemployment of resources
- **Increases in the price level may slow down a lot**, and it is even possible that prices in some sectors may begin to fall.

### Trough
- Represents the cycle's minimum level of GDP, or the end of the contraction
- There may now be **widespread unemployment**
- A trough is followed by a new period of expansion/recovery, marking the beginning of a new cycle

## Nature of the cycles
- Each cycle lasts several years, but we cannot generalise and there may be irregularity in duration and intensity
- A trend overall is desirable
- Large cyclic fluctuations are not desirable though
- Can use BTC to
	- **reduce intensity** of expansions and contractions

### Indicators
- An indicator is anything that can be used to predict future financial or economic trends
	- e.g. government data
- Types are
	- **Leading Indicators**
		- signal future events - examples are new housing starts, money supply, M2, consumer confidence, share prices and bond yields
		- not always right!
	- **Lagging Indicators**
		- One that follows an event, confirming an economic event
		- *UNEMPLOYMENT* is the big one
		- The *CPI* is also good.
	- **Coincident Indicators**
		- occur *approximately* at the same time as the conditions they signify
		- *PERSONAL INCOME* is a good one but;
		- *GDP* is the best one.



leading
- share prices, bond yields and consumer and business sentiment
lagging
- unemployment and cpi
coincident
 - personal income and gdp


expansion, peak, contraction, trough
in an expansion, economic activity and employment of resources is increasing, inflation is increasing and unemployment is decreasing
in a peak, inflation is substantially high compared to the rest of the cycle, employment of resources is maximized and there is minimal unemployment
in a contraction real gdp is falling, and if this persists for two quarters or more it is termed a recession. increases in price level will slow down and it is possible that some prices in some sectors may fall
in a trough employment of resources is minimal, unemployment is relatively high and widespread, and this marks the start of a new cycle.
