### Australia's Linkages between economies, including trade, investment, tourism and migration
#### Trends
- Four trends have **affected the relationship between trade and development** since 2000
	1. Economic growth of **developing countries**
	2. Growing **integration of global production** through supply chains
	3. **Higher prices** for agricultural goods and natural resources
	4. **Increasing interdependence** of the world economy, which causes shocks to reverberate more quickly globally

#### Linkages between economies
- Always think *flows* - move in both direction (e.g. tourism to Australia and to China)
- There are **four key linkages** between economies. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">these definitions are my own</mark>
	1. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Trade</mark> - The exchange of goods and services between countries
	2. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Tourism</mark> - Persons travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for any purpose such as personal or business
	3. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Migration</mark> - The movement of people from their place of residence to a new host country for the purpose of settling there in the long term 
	4. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Investment</mark> - the purchasing of assets from another country for future financial return or benefit
- **Linkage with Singapore**
	- Trade. Singapore is Australia's **largest** investment and trading partner in southeast Asia, and the fifth largest overall ($59.2B$ in 2022).  top export from singapore is refined petroleum. top export from australia to singapore is gold.
		- There is a free trade agreement between Singapore and Australia; this includes the elimination of tariffs.
		- Also, the geographical proximity between Australia and Singapore aids in trade.

### Composition and Direction of Australia's trade
#### Patterns and trends in global trade
- **Trade Patterns** refer to the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">composition and direction</mark> of goods and services in a country's trade
	- The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">composition</mark> of goods refers to the different categories of goods and services that a country can import or export
		- reflects the **nation's natural resource wealth** - Australia is rich in natural resources
	- the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">direction</mark> refers to the export destination and the origin of imports in terms of countries or groups of countries
		- reflected in its **close proximity to asia**
- **Trends** refer to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">HOW and WHY</mark> the composition and direction of exports and imports have changed over time

#### Trade Intensity
- **Trade Intensity**
	- Measures an economy's integration with the world economy. A higher trade intensity means an economy is more susceptible to external shocks in the world economy.
	- It is the **sum of exports and imports over real GDP** - $$(\frac{X+M}{GDP})\times 100$$ (in Australia it is $40\%$)inf
- **Factors that determine a country's trade intensity**
	1. Relative size of the economy
	2. Location relative to foreign markets (proximity)
	3. Extent of barriers to trade (natural and artificial)
- **Factors that influence economic transactions between economies**
	1. **Exchange** rates
	2. **World** Economic **Growth** - if the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">rest of the world is booming</mark>, there would be more demand for exports
	3. **Domestic** Economic **Growth** - if <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">we are booming</mark>, we will demand more, so imports increase
	4. Relative **inflation** rates - <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">higher inflation rates</mark> would lead to higher demand for <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">imports</mark>, and less for exports
	5. Relative **interest** rates - <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">higher interest rates</mark> lead to more investment in Australia
	6. **Productivity** and **Cost** **efficiency** - if a country is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">better at producing things</mark>, they will be more competitive, and the demand for their goods would <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">increase</mark>

#### Composition
- **Exports**
	- **Primary Industries** dominate Australian <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">exports</mark>
		- Manufactured goods have been Australia's most important import category
		- Changes to **composition** have been associated with rapid increase in mineral and energy exports and the decline in rural exports
	- The **composition of Australia's trade** will reflect its **comparative advantage**
		- Traditionally Australia has been a **major exporter of primary commodities**
		- we have a large resource/population ratio and substantial mineral wealth
		- We have <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">enjoyed a comparative advantage in the production of primary goods</mark> - specifically agricultural and resources
		- However, over the **past few decades** there has been a significant <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">increase</mark> in the relative importance of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">mineral and energy</mark> resources and a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">decline</mark> in the importance of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">rural exports</mark>
			- agriculture is still large
	- **Reasons for change**
		- Rapid growth in <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">China</mark> and other Asian economies that resulted in a major resources boom in Australia from 2001-2012
		- Even with the<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> end of the mining boom</mark>, resources are likely to remain **dominant**
		- So, **for exports**,
			1. Dramatic decline in rural exports
			2. A significant increase in resource (minerals and fuels) exports
			3. A relative decline in manufacturing exports
			4. The increasing importance of services exports (especially tourism and education)
- **Imports**
	- For <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">imports</mark>, the largest category is intermediate goods, consisting mainly of fuels and processed industrial goods
	- our most important **service export** is **education**
	- our largest **import** is **personal travel** (greater than even motor vehicles!)
		- this is how much Australians spend **overseas**
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">The composition of our trade is a reflection of the structure of the economy</mark>
	- Australia has a very efficient and internationally competitive primary sector, due to both **mining and agriculture** (at least compared to **manufactured products**)
	- The **services** category is growing for both imports and exports
	- We are **heavily dependant** on other economies for manufactured and capital goods

#### Direction
- Europe $\rightarrow$ Asia over time
- **China**, **Japan** and the **USA** are responsible for 46% of two way trade

### Extent and Importance of trade
- **Australia:
	- World's largest exporter of iron ore, coal and wool
	- Without trade this would <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">not be possible</mark>
- **Reasons**:
	- **Proportion of Growth**: Trade represents <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">46% of GDP for Australia</mark>
	- **Driver of growth**: Over the last 30 years the Australian economy has <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">doubled</mark>, with exports accounting for over a **quarter** of this growth
	- **Liberalisation:** over the last 30 years this has contributed to higher real GDP
	- **Employment**: One in five Australians are employed in a trade related activity
	- **Consumer welfare**: Access to a wider variety of goods and services at more competitive prices, improving <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">standard of living</mark>
	- **Competition:** from overseas markets, compels Australian firms to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">innovate and adopt more innovative methods</mark>

Historically Australia has been more comparative advantage but is shifting to competitive.
