#### What is economics?
- **Basic Economic Problem** forms core of econs
	- Scarcity - Unlimited wants and limited resources - resources are scarce limited to wants
	- Choices - have to be made between resources due to the scarcity of them
	- Opportunity Cost - Value of next best alternative foregone by making a **choice**
- To solve the BEP, **four questions**. **Economic Systems exist to solve these four questions**
	- What to produce?
	- How to produce?
	- For whom to produce?
	- How much to produce?
- **Systems**
	- Planned Economy
	- Free Market Economy
	- Mixed Economy
		- Australia
- **Two types** of economics
	- Microeconomics - individual/consumer level
	- Macroeconomics - nationwide
- **Don't need to know! Not in objectives**
	- Positive economics - testing and developing economic theory 'what is' or 'what should be' - subjects are testable objectively
		- Raising interest rates makes borrowing more expensive
	- Normative economics - reflect opinions rather than facts, cannot be tested objectively
		- The freer the market, the freer the people

#### The use of models
- Simplified representation of economic reality showing relationship between certain economic variables
- Determine cause and effect
- Ability to predict events accurately
- For example, The [[#Production Possibility Frontier]]

###### Production Possibility Frontier
- Used to visualise the opportunity cost of producing one good/service over another. **BEP** is best demonstrated with a PPF. There are three main assumptions;
	- Resources are fixed
	- Technology is fixed
	- Economy produces only 2 goods
- Each axis are goods
	- Bowed out curve (realistic)
	- Straight curve (constant opportunity cost)
	- Inside curve - inefficient points
	- Outside - unattainable points
	- On curve - efficient and attainable
	- Curve can shift if technology or resources change

#### Characteristics of a Market Economy
- Solves the BEP in a network of seperate but interconnected markets
- **Markets have;**
	- Buyers (create demand)
	- Sellers (create supply)
	- A commodity (that is bought or sold)
	- Voluntary exchange (between buyers and sellers)
	- A process, mechanics or arrangement through which buyers and sellers 'meet'
	- Price (dependant on strength of demand and supply)
- Two types;
	- **Product** markets:
		- Demand is created by consumers or households
		- Deal in the buying and selling of goods and services
		- Supply is created by producers and firms
	- **Factor** markets:
		- Deal in the buying and selling of factors of production (Land, Labour, Capital, Enterprise)
		- Demand created by firms
		- Supply created by households

###### Key features of a market economy
- Property rights and private ownership
- Economic freedom (able to choose one's own participation in the economy)
- Self-interest
- Competition
- Moral Hazards (there are consequences of poor decision making)
- Limited role of government (mainly regulatory)
