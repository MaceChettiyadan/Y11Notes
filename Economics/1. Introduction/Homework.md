# Summary Notes - CH1
#### What is Economics?
- Economics deals with two basic facts.
	- People are faced with **limited resources**
	- People have **unlimited wants**
	- This is the **Basic Economic Problem** (BEP)
		- The BEP is a problem of both [[#Scarcity]] and choice
		- To formalise, 'Economics is the study of how people allocate their limited resources to satisfy their unlimited wans - the study of the economic problem, which is one of scarcity and choice.' #testanswer
- To **solve the BEP**, three basic questions should be answered;
	- What to produce?
	- How to produce?
	- For whom to produce?
- In doing so, economics is a **social science**
- Wants are unlimited, recurring, complimentary (iphone -> airpods), specific to a person, location and time, and have varying levels of importance

###### Scarcity
- Anything that has a **price** is **scarce**.
	- **Free goods** are those that are not relatively scarce and do not have a price (for example, air breathed)
- It is important to not confuse scarcity with a shortage
	- A shortage occurs when the supply of something is limited
	- Scarcity is the fundamental issue of infinite wants

###### Choice
- Because of scarcity - because of the limited resources, **we must choose between one option or the other**
	- For example, I have the limited amount of $15 - do i
		- a) Go to the movies or   
		- b) Go to a restaurant?
- Making choices when confronted by scarcity involves a  **trade-off**

##### Opportunity Cost
- This all leads into the concept of opportunity cost.
	- Choice, as demonstrated above, must exist due to the BEP
	- Because of this, whenever making a choice, we are sacrificing any other choices we could have made
	- Opportunity cost is therefore the value of this other choice - the value of the next best alternative foregone
- The **PPF** is one of many [[#Economic Models]] which describes opportunity cost
- The PPF can also illustrate economic growth through shifts right and left

#### Types of Resources
- There are three main types of **resources**, also known as **factors of production**
	- Natural
	- Human
	- Capital

###### Natural Resources
- The gifts of nature; resources such as air, minerals, water, coal, oil

#### Micro and Macroeconomics
- The subject matter of economics is divided into micro and macroeconomics
- **Macro**economics deals with the economic problem from society's point of view
	- It is concerned with the performance of the whole economy
- **Micro**economics deals withe ceonomics from an individual point of view - referring to a small perspective


#### Economic Models
- A **simplified** representation of economic reality showing the relationship between certain economic variables
	- Not inclusive of all detailed; simplified to show key correlations
- It is assumed that people have **rational self-interest** - that economic decisions are based on a person following a logical process
	- Rationality is determined as benefit exceeding cost
	- Price is useful for measuring both

###### Positive and Normative
- Beside developing models, **developing theory is known as positive economics** - 'what is' in the economy
- On the other hand, normative economics is the domain of 'what should be' - largely opinionated
	- Normative statements incolve a **value judgement** - an opinion that one situation is pererable above another
