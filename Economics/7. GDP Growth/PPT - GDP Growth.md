## Economic Growth
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">An increase in the capacity of an economy to produce goods and services over time</mark> #testanswer 
	1. **Potential Growth** - the rate of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">increase in the capacity</mark> of the economy to satisfy the needs and wants of people in an economy
	2. **Actual Growth** - the rate of change in <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">real gross domestic product </mark> over a given period of time
- Relates to Australia's macroeconomic objective of sustainable economic growth
	- i.e. growth that can be maintained over a long period of time - a rate of $3-4\%$ in GDP
#### PPF model
##### Actual Growth
- If an economy is operating **inside** its PPF and produces more as a result of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">using previously unemployed resources, or using resources more efficiently</mark>, this is referred to as **actual growth**
	- This is illustrated by *a movement from a point within the PPF to a point towards or on the PPF*
	- **Demand Side**
##### Potential Growth
- The productive potential of an economy may be increase by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">an increase in the quality and/or quantity of resources</mark> and, when this occurs, it is known as **potential growth**
	- i.e. growth in the *capacity* to produce more
	- **Supply Side**

#### Measuring economic growth
- The economic <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">growth rate is the rate of change in GDP</mark>
	- **GDP:** the total market value of all final goods and services produced in a country during a certain time period
	- **Nominal GDP is expressed:**$$\frac{GDP(b)-GDP(a)}{GDP(a)}\times 100$$
- We should **refine** GDP by taking into account inflation
	- This is **real GDP** and is simply nominal - the inflation rate
- **Refining further,** we take into account population to have Average **real GDP per person** known as **Real GDPpc**

#### Limitations of GDP
- Income Distribution
- True value of public goods and merit goods is largely unknown
- Does not account for hidden economies or non-market production
- Understates changes in utility (ability of goods and services to satisfy wants)
	- Doesn't capture significant technological progress that increases utility without increasing price by much
- Does not describe non-material welfare
- Does not account for rising productivity

## Determinants of Economic Growth
### Potential Growth
#### Population Growth
- Increase the total size of the economy; greater demand for G+S and productive factors
- Increase in size of the labour force - migration but also natural
- Migration more than natural: migration promotes transfer of wealth, knowledge and skills and positive fiscal impact (tax revenue)
