## Economic Growth
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">An increase in the capacity of an economy to produce goods and services over time</mark> #testanswer 
	1. **Potential Growth** - the rate of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">increase in the capacity</mark> of the economy to satisfy the needs and wants of people in an economy
	2. **Actual Growth** - the rate of change in <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">real gross domestic product </mark> over a given period of time
- Relates to Australia's macroeconomic objective of sustainable economic growth
	- i.e. growth that can be maintained over a long period of time - a rate of $3-4\%$ in GDP
#### PPF model
##### Actual Growth
- If an economy is operating **inside** its PPF and produces more as a result of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">using previously unemployed resources, or using resources more efficiently</mark>, this is referred to as **actual growth**
	- This is illustrated by *a movement from a point within the PPF to a point towards or on the PPF*
	- **Demand Side**
##### Potential Growth
- The productive potential of an economy may be increase by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">an increase in the quality and/or quantity of resources</mark> and, when this occurs, it is known as **potential growth**
	- i.e. growth in the *capacity* to produce more
	- **Supply Side**

#### Measuring economic growth
- The economic <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">growth rate is the rate of change in GDP</mark>
	- **GDP:** the total market value of all final goods and services produced in a country during a certain time period
	- **Nominal GDP is expressed:**$$\frac{GDP(b)-GDP(a)}{GDP(a)}\times 100$$
- We should **refine** GDP by taking into account inflation
	- This is **real GDP** and is simply nominal - the inflation rate
- **Refining further,** we take into account population to have Average **real GDP per person** known as **Real GDPpc**

#### Limitations of GDP
- Income Distribution
- True value of public goods and merit goods is largely unknown
- Does not account for hidden economies or non-market production
- Understates changes in utility (ability of goods and services to satisfy wants)
	- Doesn't capture significant technological progress that increases utility without increasing price by much
- Does not describe non-material welfare
- Does not account for rising productivity

## Determinants of Economic Growth
### Potential Growth
#### Population Growth
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Increase the total size of the economy</mark>; greater demand for G+S and productive factors
- Increase in size of the labour force - migration but also natural
- Migration more than natural: migration promotes transfer of wealth, knowledge and skills and positive fiscal impact (tax revenue)

#### Labour Force Participation
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Proportion of people over 15 years old who are in paid work or actively looking for work</mark>
- **Higher involvement at work**, increasing the capacity of production
- Government tax revenue increase

#### Rising labour productivity
##### Capital Deepening
-  The amount of output produced per hour worked
	- **Capital Deepening**: more technology used, increase in the stock of capital relative to other productive resources
- Production becomes more capital intensive, increasing labour productive
	- technology changes and improvements of function which help to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">increase the level of output</mark>

##### Multi-factor Productivity
- All other factors that improve a worker's ability to produce goods and sergices (not capita)
	- Changes in human capital: knowledge and skills that workers develop through education and experience

### Actual Growth
#### Factors affecting spending in the economy
- Consumption
- Investment
- Government Expenditure
- Net Exports (Exports less Imports)


## Benefits and Costs
### Benefits
- Increased <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">material standard of living</mark>
	- Increased **quantity** of goods and services
	- Satisfy more wants and needs
- Increase level of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">real income</mark>
	- How much money an individual or entity makes **after accounting for inflation**
	- Satisfy more **needs and wants** with increased level of income
- **Reduce unemployment**
	- Growth is clearly likely to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">stimulate demand for labour</mark>, and it is likely that more people will be employed and fewer unemployed
- **Improved Efficiency**
	- Promote knowledge, skills, productivity and tech changes which leads to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">higher quality of goods ands services</mark>
- **Fiscal Dividend**
	- Rising income will lead to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">higher taxation revenue</mark> which can be used for public and merit goods such as infrastructure and health
	- Public and merit goods generate considerable <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">external benefits</mark>. More hospitals and schools mean a healthier and better-educated population, which generates other economic benefits in terms of **effectiveness of the labour force**
### Costs
- **Structural Unemployment**
	- From structural change: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">when people want a new type of G+S</mark> and when inventions and the such make it possible also when businesses seek to reduce costs
- **Inflationary pressure**
	- When resources are fully employed and the economy is working near its capacity
- **Environmental Degradation**
	- As production and consumption increase, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">negative externalities</mark> are likely to arise, as well as the likelihood of increased depletion of non-renewable resources
- **Social Dislocation**
	- High rates of growth may lead to crimes, stress suicide.\
