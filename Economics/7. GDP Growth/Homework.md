### Macroeconomic objectives
- The key macroeconomic objectives are
	- Sustainable economic growth
	- Price stability
	- Full employment
- **Economic growth** is defined as an increase in the real output of goods and services produced in a country
	- Measured in [[#GDP]]
	- A desirable growth rate in *Australia is 3% p.a.*
		- We want to ensure sustainability and employment

#### Sustainability
- Encompasses means;
- **Price stability**
	- refers to low levels of inflation
	- The target is 2-3% p.a.
	- This is important; inflation adversely affects the spending power of households and firms
- **Full employment**
	- Occurs when everyone who is willing to work can find employment
	- We want a *natural rate of unemployment* - currently 4.5% of the workforce
- Must recognise personal goals
- We can implement this into the PPF curve by a shift to the right

#### GDP
- Is the total market value of final goods and services produced in a country in a certain period of time
- Can be **nominal** or **real**
	- Nominal is GDP before inflation
	- Real is GDP after inflation is accounted for
- This is demonstrated in the diagram below
