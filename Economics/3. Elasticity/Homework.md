- **Elasticity** concerns responsiveness to changes in price.

## Price Elasticity of Demand
- PED is defined as the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in the price of the good or service. #testanswer 
	- The formula for $Ed$, (as per discovering economics) is $$Ed = \frac{\%change \space in \space quantity \space demanded}{\% change \space in \space price}$$
		- An $Ed < 1$ indicates a good that is **inelastic**, and this is known as the **elasticity coefficient** - to graph, a relatively **steep** curve
		- An $Ed > 1$ indicates a good that is **elastic** to changes in price - to graph, a relatively **flat** curve
		- An $Ed=0$ indicates a good that is **perfectly inelastic** - to graph, $x=n$
		- An $Ed=\infty$ indicates a good that is **perfectly elastic** - to graph, $y=n$
	- However, ***what is demonstrated above is the point method;*** this will give different answers depending on whether we are increasing or decreasing price
		- An alternative is the **midpoint method**. The formula goes as follows: $$\frac{\triangle Q}{Q_{av}}\times \frac{P_{av}}{\triangle P}$$
		- The advantge of this is that the answer does not depend on which price we choose as the starting price.

#### PED and TR/TE
- PED is important in that it has a link with **total revenue** and **total expenditure** - $TR(TE)=P\times Q$
	- Graphs in [[Powerpoint - PED]] demonstrate this correlation
	- Firms will use elasticity to price discriminate between customers - depending on whether their demand is elastic or inelastic
- **Along a linear curve**, PED changes - the top half is elastic, while the bottom is inelastic. The midpoint has an $Ed=1$.
- Again as noted in [[Powerpoint - PED]], there are five main determinants of PED
	- Availability of Substitutes
	- Whether the good is a necessity or a luxury
	- Definition of the market
	- The proportion of income spent
	- Time

## Price Elasticity of Supply
- PES measures the **responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price** #testanswer
