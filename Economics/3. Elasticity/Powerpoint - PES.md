##### The concept of PES
- Defined as *The responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price* #testanswer 
- Has the exact same formula, except quantity supplied, not demanded.
| **Elasticity**      | **Elasticity coefficient** | **Interpretation of Elasticity Coefficient**                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Elastic             | $E>1$                      | Percentage change in QS is greater than the percentage change in price. Relatively close substitutes         |
| Inelastic           | $E<1$                      | Percentage change in QS is lesser than the percentage change in price. Not many close substitutes          |
| Unitary             | $E=1$                      | Percentage change in QS is equal to percentage change in price                 |
| Perfectly Inelastic | $E=0$                      | Percentage change in QS is independant to change in price; it is unresponsive. No substitutes usually. |
| Perfectly Elastic   | $Ed=\infty$                | A small change in price will lead to a complete drop in QS or increase. Many close substitutes.                                                                              |
