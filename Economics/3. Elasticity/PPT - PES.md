##### The concept of PES
- Defined as *The responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price* #testanswer 
- Has the exact same formula, except quantity supplied, not demanded.
| **Elasticity**      | **Elasticity coefficient** | **Interpretation of Elasticity Coefficient**                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Elastic             | $E>1$                      | Percentage change in QS is greater than the percentage change in price. Relatively close substitutes         |
| Inelastic           | $E<1$                      | Percentage change in QS is lesser than the percentage change in price. Not many close substitutes          |
| Unitary             | $E=1$                      | Percentage change in QS is equal to percentage change in price                 |
| Perfectly Inelastic | $E=0$                      | Percentage change in QS is independant to change in price; it is unresponsive. No substitutes usually. |
| Perfectly Elastic   | $Ed=\infty$                | A small change in price will lead to a complete drop in QS or increase. Many close substitutes.                                                                              |

##### The distinction between goods that are price elastic and price inelastic in supply
- Basically demand but supply'd
##### Determinants of PES
- **Time**
	- Similar to demand; in the short run, goods will be priced inelastic because ***they won't be responsive***.
	- In the long run, there is more time for firms to respond to price changes
- **Nature of the industry**
	- What kind of industry it is. A market that produces pencils can easily change production, whereas in a market for agriculture, there is heavy time taken for producttion.
- **Ability to store inventories**
	- If a business is able to easily store inventories, then it is going to more responsive and elastic in supply

## Significance of Price Elasticity
- Significant to **firms**
	- Monopoly/Market power - setting prices to influence $TR$
	- Price Discrimination: To maximise $TR$
- Significant to **households**
	- Can control demand if aware of elasticity and influence on prices
- Significant to **Government**
	- Tax Incidence
	- Inelastic - greater incidence on consumers, greater tax revenue
	- Elastic - lesser incidence on consumers, lower tax revenue
