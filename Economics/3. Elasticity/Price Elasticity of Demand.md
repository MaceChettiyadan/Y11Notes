###### Define the concept, and measurement, of price elasticity of demand
- **Price elasticity of demand** measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price #testanswer 
	- Can be calculated by Percentage Change (Point Method 1) - $$Ed = \frac{\%change \space in \space quantity \space demanded}{\% change \space in \space price}$$
		- Also, the Midpoint Method - $$\frac{(Q_2-Q_1)/[(Q_2+Q_1)/2]}{(P_2-P_1)/[(P_2+P_1)/2]}$$ (it is **wrong** but hmm????)
		- Point Method 2 $$\frac{\triangle Q}{Q}\times \frac{P}{\triangle P}$$
- **Two categories**
	- **Price Elastic** products are ones where the quantity demanded of the product is relatively responsive to changes in price
		- Percentage change in quantity demanded $>$ percentage change in price
		- $|Ed|>1$
		- These products usually have relatively close substitutes
		- To graph, a very steep curve
	- **Price Inelastic** products are ones where the quantity demanded of the product is relatively unresponsive to changes in price
		- Percentage change in quantity demanded $<$ percentage change in price
		- $|Ed|<1$
		- These products cannot be substituted very well usually
		- To graph, a very flat curve
- $+$ **Special Situations**
	- **Perfectly elastic** - $Ed=\infty$, i.e changes in price cause an infinity change in quantity demanded
		- So, if price changes, quantity demanded falls to zero
		- Reflects a perfectly competitive market
		- To graph, a full flat curve
	- **Perfectly inelastic** - $Ed = 0$
		- Quantity demanded remains the same regardless of price
		- Reflects a market where there is fixed demand regardless of price - usually *needs* such as drugs.
		- To graph, a vertical line.
	- **Unitary Elastic** - $Ed = 1$
		- Changes in price equal changes in quantity demanded






###### Explain the determinants of price elasticity of demand
###### Distinguish between goods that are price elastic and price inelastic in demand
###### Demonstrate and describe the link between price elasticity of demand and total revenue
- **Total Revenue** is $P\times Q$
	- Graphically, this is the box of $PQ$, with a corner $(0,0)$
	- From here, we can calculate gains and losses (difference in boxes)
	- **Effect of changes in price on total revenue** is dependant on the price elasticity of the product;
		- For an inelastic good, price has a direct relationship to total revenue (inc. price = inc. total revenue)
		- For an elastic good, price has an inverse relationship to total revenue (inc. price = dec. total revenue)
		- Unitary goods have a constant total revenue
- Depending on elasticity, **tax revenue** and the burden of tax would vary
	- Tax incidence/burden of the tax: Who bears the majority of the tax
	- If a good is price inelastic in demand, the amount of tax revenue is higher and the burden of the tax falls more on the consumers
		- Relatively **small** change in quantity demanded
	- If a good is price elastic in demand, the amount of tax revenue is lower and the burden of the tax falls more on the producers
		- Relatively **large** change in quantity demanded
