- If there was a 10% increase in the price of the goods below, would you stop purchasing them?

##### Define the concept, and measurement, of price elasticity of demand
- **Price elasticity of demand** measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price #testanswer 
	- Can be calculated by Percentage Change (Point Method 1) - $$Ed = \frac{\%change \space in \space quantity \space demanded}{\% change \space in \space price}$$
		- Also, the Midpoint Method - $$\frac{(Q_2-Q_1)/[(Q_2+Q_1)/2]}{(P_2-P_1)/[(P_2+P_1)/2]}$$ (it is **wrong** but hmm????)
		- Point Method 2 $$\frac{\triangle Q}{Q}\times \frac{P}{\triangle P}$$

##### Explain the determinants of price elasticity of demand
- There are **five main** determinants/factors of **PED**
	- **The availability of *substitutes*** - if there are substitutes available, a good would be much more elastic
	- **Whether the good is a *necessity* or a *luxury*** - necessities would be inelastic, while luxuries would be elastic
	- **Proportion of income spent** - cheaper goods tend to be inelastic and unresponsive to price change, so higher income spent $\rightarrow$ more elastic
	- **Time period considered**
	- **The definition of the market**

##### Distinguish between goods that are price elastic and price inelastic in demand
- **Two categories**
	- **Price Elastic** products are ones where the quantity demanded of the product is relatively responsive to changes in price
		- Percentage change in quantity demanded $>$ percentage change in price
		- $|Ed|>1$
		- These products usually have relatively close substitutes
		- To graph, a very steep curve
	- **Price Inelastic** products are ones where the quantity demanded of the product is relatively unresponsive to changes in price
		- Percentage change in quantity demanded $<$ percentage change in price
		- $|Ed|<1$
		- These products cannot be substituted very well usually
		- To graph, a very flat curve

###### Special Situations
- $+$ **Special Situations**
	- **Perfectly elastic** - $Ed=\infty$, i.e changes in price cause an infinity change in quantity demanded
		- So, if price changes, quantity demanded falls to zero
		- Reflects a perfectly competitive market
		- To graph, a full flat curve
	- **Perfectly inelastic** - $Ed = 0$
		- Quantity demanded remains the same regardless of price
		- Reflects a market where there is fixed demand regardless of price - usually *needs* such as drugs.
		- To graph, a vertical line.
	- **Unitary Elastic** - $Ed = 1$
		- Changes in price equal changes in quantity demanded

##### Demonstrate and describe the link between price elasticity of demand and total revenue
- **Total Revenue** is $P\times Q$
	- Graphically, this is the box of $PQ$, with a corner $(0,0)$
	- From here, we can calculate gains and losses (difference in boxes)
	- **Effect of changes in price on total revenue** is dependant on the price elasticity of the product;
		- For an inelastic good, price has a direct relationship to total revenue (inc. price = inc. total revenue)
		- For an elastic good, price has an inverse relationship to total revenue (inc. price = dec. total revenue)
		- Unitary goods have a constant total revenue

###### Tax Revenue & Elasticity
- Depending on elasticity, **tax revenue** and the burden of tax would vary
	- Tax incidence/burden of the tax: Who bears the majority of the tax
	- If a good is price inelastic in demand, the amount of tax revenue is higher and the burden of the tax falls more on the consumers
		- Relatively **small** change in quantity demanded
		- Think about cigarettes; it is inelastic and people will buy no matter what. The burden then falls on the consumers due to this.
	- If a good is price elastic in demand, the amount of tax revenue is lower and the burden of the tax falls more on the producers
		- Relatively **large** change in quantity demanded
- **Sample Question** - What is the impact of a tax on a product that is inelastic in demand?
	- **My response;** When a tax is levied on an inelastic product, we can observe the supply curve shifting from $S$ to $S_{Tax}$. Because of this, the equilibrium shifts from $(Q_{1,}P_1)$ to $(Q_{2,}P_2)$. In doing so, the price that consumers pay becomes $Q_2$, and the amount that producers receive becomes $P_3$. We can then observe that tax revenue becomes $(P_2-P_{3}) \times Q_2$. The burden of tax is mostly placed on consumers, as the gap from $P_1$ to $P_2$ is greater than that from $P_1$ to $P_3$.
	- **Ideal Response**. *Indirect* tax will shift the supply curve to the left by the amount of the tax. Tje tax increases price to $P_2$, and increases the price that consumers now pay. Producers are now receiving $P_3$ in revenue. Quantity has fallen to $Q_2$. The tax revenue is $(P_2-P_{3}) \times Q_2$. The conumers bear a higher burden of the tax compared to the producers. There is a relatively small decrease in quantity.
