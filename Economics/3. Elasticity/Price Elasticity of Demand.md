###### Define the concept, and measurement, of price elasticity of demand
- **Price elasticity of demand** measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price #testanswer 
	- Can be calculated by Percentage Change (Point Method) - $Ed = \frac{\%change \space in \space quantity \space demanded}{\% change \space in \space price}$
- **Two categories**
	- **Price Elastic** products are ones where the quantity demanded of the product is relatively responsive to changes in price
		- Percentage change in quantity demanded $>$ percentage change in price
		- $|Ed|>1$
		- These products usually have relatively close substitutes
	- **Price Inelastic** products are ones where the quantity demanded of the product is relatively unresponsive to changes in price
		- Percentage change in quantity demanded $<$ percentage change in price
		- $|Ed|<1$
		- These products cannot be substituted very well usually
- $+$ **Special Situations**
	- **Perfectly elastic** - $Ed=\infty$, i.e changes in price cause an infinity change in quantity demanded
		- So, if price changes, quantity demanded falls to zero
		- Reflects a perfectly competitive market
	- **Perfectly inelastic** - $Ed = 0$
		- Quantity demanded remains the same regardless of price
		- Reflects a market where there is fixed demand regardless of price - usually *needs* such as drugs.
	- **Unitary Elastic** - $Ed = 1$
		- Changes in price equal changes in quantity demanded
