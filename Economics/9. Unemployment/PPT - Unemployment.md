## Unemployment
- Refers to the people who are willing and able to work but cannot find a job
	- Can be voluntary or involuntary
- Unemployment rate is the measure of unemployment: Proportion of labour force who are willing and ...

### Key Terms
- **Working Age Population**: Part of population that is of working age ($>15$)
- **Labour Force**: The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">portion</mark> of the working age population who are either working, or are actively seeking work
- **Participation Rate:** <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Proportion</mark> of the working age population who are wither working, or are actively seeking work
- **Underemployment:** People who wish to work longer hours but cannot/is not given by their employee
- **Disguised unemployment:** when people are employed less than they would like to
- **Hidden unemployment:** Discouraged workers: workers who choose not to participate in the labour force because previous efforts to find a job have been frustrated
- **non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU):** unemployment that can not be reduced by expanding aggregate demand (full employment

### Measure
- Unemployment rate = $\frac{unemployed}{labour \space force}\times 100$
- Labour force participation rate = $\frac{labour\space force}{working \space age \space population} \times 100$
- Limitations
	- Does not account for hidden unemployment
	- Does not account for underemployment
	- Excludes people with disabilities

### Types of Unemployment
#### Cyclical Unemployment
- Follows the **cyclical movements of the business cycle**
- Derived from the demand for final goods and services and follows fluctuations of the business cycle
#### Structural Unemployment
- When there is a mismatch of available and required skills in a sector of the economy
	- e.g. by replacement of labour by capital
- Causes are
	- Changes in **technology**
	- Changes in the **demand** for productive factors
	- Changes in the **pattern of consumer demand**
- Can be **long term**, especially for older workers
- Will **always exist** in the economy
#### Frictional Unemployment
- Unemployment that occurs due to the job search that occurs when in transition between different jobs
- Is most likely to be **short term**

### Impacts of Unemployment
- Lower levels of **AE**, investment and business confidence
	- UE indicates that resources are under-utilised
	- There is a gap between actual GDP and potential GDP
- Higher **welfare payments**
	- Opportunity cost: Potential expenditure on infrastructure, health or education
- Increased **social problems**
	- such as depression, violence and ***<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">CRIME!</mark>***
- dactyloid and riziform

#### Impact on distribution of income
- Affects different groups of people differently
	- Dependant on factors including age, health status and geographical location
- Increases income inequality

### Full Employment
- When the economy is at its maximum production capacity
	- does not mean zero (see below sub-point)
- Considered to exist when there is **zero cyclical unemployment**
	- **Structural and frictional** will **still exist** 

### Natural Rate of Unemployment
- Structural UE + frictional UE
- Below $5\%$

### Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment
- key challenge for policymakers is to achieve **low rates of unemployment** without fuelling **excessive increases in wage growth** and **inflation**
	- the lowest rate of unemployment that achieves this is **NAIRU**
- difference between NAIRU and real unemployment rate is known as the **unemployment rate gap**
