## The concepts of income and wealth
- **Stock vs flow**
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Stock:</mark> a quantity measured at a fixed period of time, e.g. GDP, inventories
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Flow:</mark> a quantity which is measured with reference to a period of time e.g. income, depreciation 
- **Income**
	- The receipt of spending power by persons. Such income may be productive or non-productive (<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">flow of wealth</mark>)
		- **Non-Productive Income** - also known as transfer income is received from the government by persons as cash social service benefits such as pensions
		- **Productive Income** - also known as factor income, a reward to the factors of production
	- **Types**
		- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Private Income:</mark> income earnt as an employee/self-employed person
		- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Gross Income:</mark> private income plus government transfer payments
		- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Disposable Income:</mark> gross income less tax
		- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Final Income:</mark> Disposable income and any indirect government benefits
			- an example of a benefit can be infrastructure, education, healthcare
- **Wealth**
	- Is a **stock** variable (<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">stock of assets</mark>)
	- Refers to the stock of assets held - land, houses, shares, government securities, consumer durables such as cars, money
		- **LESS** the liabilities including mortgage, bank loans and amounts owing on credit cards
	- May be <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">acquired from inheritance, saving, income or luck</mark>
## The measurement of the income and wealth distribution, i.e. the Lorenz curve, Gini Coefficient
- Poverty:
	- **Absolute poverty:** a situation where people live below a subsistence level of income
	- **Relative poverty:** a situation where people do not achieve what our society defines as a minimum standard of living
- **Income Inequality**
	- a measure of the unevenness in income distribution within a population
	- Can be illustrated using <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">the lorenz curve</mark> and represented using the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">gini coefficient</mark>

#### Lorenz Curve
- Population is ranked according to their income, from the lowest to highest income
- A **model** showing <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">cumulative proportion of the population</mark>, ranked by income, against <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">their cumulative share of income</mark>
- Is called the line of equality

#### Gini Coefficient
- **Measures** the degree of **income inequality** in a country
	- between $0$ and $1$ where $1$ is absolute inequality and $0$ is income equality
	- measured as <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">(area between diagonal and lorenz curve)/(entire area under the diagonal)</mark>

#### Explanation of Inequality
- **Personal traits** e.g. personalities and talents
- **Occupational conditions** e.g. training, education and responsibilities
- **Opportunities**
- **Other factors** e.g. sickness, disabilities, age and <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">LUCK</mark>

### Strategies for income distribution
- **Direct taxation** - personal tax is progressive, the use of brackets and whatnot
- **Transfer payments** - cash support for different groups
- **Indirect government payments** - social transfers increase access to basic services which may be under consumed if provided by the market
