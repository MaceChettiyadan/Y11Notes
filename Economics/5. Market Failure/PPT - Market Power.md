#### Outline the characteristics of an imperfectly competitive market
#### Explain the concept and causes of market power
- **Perfect Competition**
	- Large number of buyers and sellers
	- Firms are price takers (no market powers)
	- Homogenous products (exactly same)
	- No barriers to entry or exit
	- Big Example: Agricultural Markets
- **Monopolies**
	- One firm
	- No close substitutes for product
	- Firms are price setters
	- High barriers to entry
	- E.g. utilities such as water and energy
- **Oligopoly**
	- Few large firms
	- Goods are close substitutes
	- Barriers to entry exist
	- Sellers are interdependant, engaging in strategic behaviour
	- E.g. supermarkets (Coles, Woolworths, IGA,, Aldi) and telcos.
- **Monopolistic Competition**
	- Many firms
	- Differentiated products with *close* substitutes
	- Low barriers to entry
	- Information is imperfect
	- Firms are price Setters
	- E.g. phones and computers
##### Barriers to Entry
- *Economies of scale*: permitting lower average costs to be achieved as the firm increases its size
	- As a result, a large firm can charge a lower price than a smaller firm
	- This forces smaller firms out of the market, and is $\therefore$ a barrier to entry
- *Branding*: creation by a firm of a unique image and name of a product
	- Does not lead to monopolies, methods used by oligopoly and monopolistic competition, e.g. crapple.

#### Explain how market power can influence market efficiency, i.e. a deadweight loss
#### Discuss the policy options to influence market power, including regulation/legislation
