##### Types of Markets
- **Perfect Competition**
	- Large number of buyers and sellers
	- Firms are price takers (no market powers)
	- Homogenous products (exactly same)
	- No barriers to entry or exit
	- Big Example: Agricultural Markets
- **Monopolies**
	- One firm
	- No close substitutes for product
	- Firms are price setters
	- High barriers to entry
	- E.g. utilities such as water and energy
- **Oligopoly**
	- Few large firms
	- Goods are close substitutes
	- Barriers to entry exist
	- Sellers are interdependant, engaging in strategic behaviour
	- E.g. supermarkets (Coles, Woolworths, IGA,, Aldi) and telcos.
- **Monopolistic Competition**
	- Many firms
	- Differentiated products with *close* substitutes
	- Low barriers to entry
	- Information is imperfect
	- Firms are price Setters
	- E.g. phones and computers

##### Barriers to Entry
- *Economies of scale*: permitting lower average costs to be achieved as the firm increases its size
	- As a result, a large firm can charge a lower price than a smaller firm
	- This forces smaller firms out of the market, and is $\therefore$ a barrier to entry
- *Branding*: creation by a firm of a unique image and name of a product
	- Advertising campaigns that try to influence consumer tastes in favour of the product
	- Does not lead to monopolies, methods used by oligopoly and monopolistic competition, e.g. crapple.
- ***Legal Barriers***
	- *Patents*: rights given by the government to a firm that has developed a new product or invention to be its sole producer for a specified period of time
		- They will have a monopoly during this time
	- *Licenses*: granted by governments for particular professions or industries
		- Does not necesserily lead to monopoly, but may prevent competition
		- Radio, TV.
	- *Copyright*: Guarantee that an author has the sole rights to print, publish and sell copyrighted work
	- *Public franchises*: granted by the government to a firm which is to produce or supply a particular good or service
	- *Tariffs, quotas and other trade restrictions*: limit the quantities of a good that can be imported into a country
- *Control of essential resources*: monopolies can arise from ownership or control of an essential resource
	- De Beers (diamonds)
- *Aggressive tactics*: when existing firms use tactics to discourage new firms from entering the market

##### Anti-competitive behaviour
- Agreements or arrangements between firms that seek to restrain competition and remove the automatic regulation that competitive markets achieve


#### Outline the characteristics of an imperfectly competitive market
#### Explain the concept and causes of market power
- A firm has *market power* if it is able to affect the market price by varying output
	- Firms in an imperfect market have market power as they are able to do so
		- E.g. monopolies and oligopolies
		- Applies not only to a monopoly, but also to oligopoly. Oligopolistic firms sometimes act together (or collude), usualy illegaly, to acquire monopoly power
- Caused by their characteristic barriers to entry

#### Explain how market power can influence market efficiency, i.e. a deadweight loss
#### Discuss the policy options to influence market power, including regulation/legislation
