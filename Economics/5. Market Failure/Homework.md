## Market Power
#### Define the concept of market failure
- Market failure is the situation defined by the inefficient distribution of goods and services in the free market

#### Outline the characteristics of an imperfectly competitive market
- A market that is competitive is characterised by
	- A relatively **large number of firms**
	- Firms not having [[#Market Power]]
	- Firms not **differentiating** their products
	- No **barriers to entry** - no licences, blocking of resources, etc.
- However, when these conditions *are not met*, then the market is considered **imperfectly competitive market**.
	- Synergy, Australia Post

#### Explain the concept and causes of market power
- A firm has **market power** if it can affect the market price by varying its output.
- Monopoly and oligopoly firms have lots of market power
- Firms with market power will attempt to maximize profit
	- In doing so, their priorities may not align with society's, and thus a *socially optimal level of output* may not be produced

#### Explain how market power can influence market efficiency
- A competitive market (with firms not having market power) will produce where demand equals supply
	- At the equilibrium, we know $TS$ is maximized, so the market is as efficient as possible
- In the case of **market power**, quantity will not be at this equilibrium, and thus a deadweight loss is created
	- This means that *market efficiency is reduced if firms have market power*

#### Discuss the policy options to influence market power, including regulation/deregulation and legislation
- The **ACCC Act** (adminstered by the ACCC itself) is a piece of legislation that decreases market power
	- It protects, strengthens and supplements the way competition works in Australian markets and industries
- This leads to the illegality of certain behaviours
	- Cartels
	- Misuse of market power
	- Exclusive Dealing
	- Resale price maintenance
	- Predatory pricing
	- Collective boycotts
	- Mergers or Acquisitions
- In response, the **policy options are**
	- *Expand* the *number* or types of businesses
	- *Expand* the *ability* of businesses to compete
	- *Increase* the *incentive* for businesses to compete
	- *Expand* the *choices and information* available to consumers

## Externalities
#### Explain the concept of externalities
- The market reflects the buying and selling intentions of consumers and producers
- There are cases when the production and consumption of a good can create external *costs* or *benefits*
	- These are **externalities**
	- Externalities can be positive or negative depending on whether they are benefits or costs

#### Explain the influence of externalities on market efficiency
##### Negative Externalities
- Driving cars causing pollution, cigarettes and health, etc.
- When economic actions from either production or consumption create an external cost, it is referred to as a **negative externality**
	- For products with negative externalities, the market quantity *will always be greater* than the optimal quantity and will cause the market price to be less than the optimal price
- Also, a **DWL** is created.
	- The market also overproduces. It is very inefficient
- ***Social cost is equal to private costs plus external costs*

##### Positive externalities
- Consider health clubs and gyms
	- They improve health, give back to the producer, and in improving health, improve the efficiency of the worker and thus stimulate the economy
	- Some of the benefits of the producer have *'spilled'* over to a third party - this is a positive externality
- A **DWL** is still created because the market underproduces, it is still inefficient
- ***Social benefit is equal to private benefits plus external benefits***

#### Discuss the policy options to correct for externalities, including the use of taxes and subsidies
- As seen above, when externalities exist, the market outcome is guaranteed to be inefficient
- This can be alleviated by **taxes** and **subsidies**
	- A **negative externality** will overproduce as we have discussed; to counter this, the government can impose a **tax** that will shift the *supply curve left*
	- A **positive externality** will underproduce; to counter this, the government can impose a **subsidy** that will shift the *supply curve right*

## Public goods and common resources
#### Outline the classification of goods, i.e. based on rivalry and excludability
- **Two types**
	- **Rival** - does the consumption by one party reduce the supply available for another
	- **Excludable** - is it possible to exclude a non-payer from the good or service
- There are [[#Private Goods]], [[#Club Goods]], [[#Common Property Resources]] and [[#Public Goods]]

##### Private Goods
- Are **rival** *and* **excludable**
	- for example, clothing, food.

##### Club Goods
- Are **non-rival** *and* **excludable**
	- Gyms, Concerts

##### Merit & Demerit Goods
###### Merit Goods
- Goods that are produced that have large external benefits for society
	- Goods that will be underprovided in the economy if the product is left in the market
###### Demerit Goods
- Goods that are produced that have large external costs for society
	- Goods that will be overprovided if left in the market
- Are private goods as they are both rivary and exclusive

#### Describe the public goods and the free rider effect
##### Public Goods
- **Non-rival** *and* **Non-excludable**
	- E.g. national parks, lighthouses, national defence

##### Free rider effect
- Public goods cause the free rider effect
- Free riders enjoy the benefits of the consumption of a resource without paying for the cost of provision
- This can lead to over-consumption and rapid damage of a public resource

#### Describe common resources and the tragedy of the commons
##### Common Property Resources
- Are **rival** *and* **non-excludable**
	- Fish in the ocean

##### Tragedy of Commons
- Common Property Resources lead to tragedy of commons
- Refers to the over-consumption of common property resources, e.g. over-fishing
- Occurs as the resource is readily available and there are no restrictions on consumption
- However, once consumed the resource is not availble to any other party, leading to depletion of the resource.

#### Discuss the policy options to reduce market failure associated with public goods and common resources
- **Common Property Goods**: Enforce restrictions on consumption - e.g. fishing limits, no-fishing xones, fishing licenses, etc.
- **Public Goods**: Create ownership of the resource, e.g. fees for public transport, fines for damaging public property
