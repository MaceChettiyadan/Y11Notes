#### Terminology
- **Demand**: private benefits that consumers receive
- **Supply**: private costs of production
- **MPC** (Marginal Private Cost): costs to producers of producing one more unit of a good
- **MSC**: costs to society of producing one more unit of a good
- **MPB**: Benefits to consumers from consuming one more unit of a good
- **MSB**: benefits to society from consuming one more unit of a good
- When MPC=MSC and MPB=MSB, socially optimal equilibrium is achieved.

##### Exernalities
- Occur when the production or consumption of a good/service cause external costs and/or external benefits
	- *because* Side effects of conomic activity to a third party or unintended consequence of economic activity
- Externalities cause market failure if the **price mechanism** does not take into account the **social costs** and benefits of production and consumption

#### The distinction between  positive and negative externalities
##### Negative Externalities
- Occurs when production and/or consumption creates an **external cost**
- Causes overconsumption/production - there's always more than what we want being produced
	- Market quantity is greater than optimal quantity
	- Market price is less than optimal price
- Results in *deadweight loss*
- Two types: a [[#Negative Production Externality]] and a [[#Negative Consumption Externality]]

###### Negative Production Externality
- Where the *marginal social cost* of production is higher than the *marginal private cost*
- Examples include
	- air
	- land
	- noise pollution

###### Negative Consumption Externality
- Where the *marginal social benefit* of consumption is lower than the *marginal private benefit*
- Examples include
	- Smoking
	- Smoking
	- Smoking
	- Alcoholism
	- Smoking
	- Alcoholism

##### Positive Externalities
- External benefits of consumption or production for third parties
	- Causes under consumption or under production
	- Results in a DWL

###### Positive Consumption Externality
- Where the *marginal social benefit* of consumption is higher than the *marginal private benefit*
- Examples include
	- Flu vaccines
	- Education

###### Positive Production Externality
- Where the *marginal social cost* of production is lower than the *marginal private cost*
- Examples include
	- Lower transport costs for local firms following construction of new roads

#### How an externality can influence market efficiency i.e. a deadweight loss
#### Policy options to correct for externalities, including the use of taxes and subsidies
- **Two** types
	- [[#Regulation/Legislation]] set by the government
	- [[#Market Based Approaches]] - taxes and subsidies
