#### Terminology
- **Demand**: private benefits that consumers receive
- **Supply**: private costs of production
- **MPC** (Marginal Private Cost): costs to producers of producing one more unit of a good
- **MSC**: costs to society of producing one more unit of a good
	- $MSC=MPC+MEC$ where $MEC=$ marginal external costs
- **MPB**: Benefits to consumers from consuming one more unit of a good
- **MSB**: benefits to society from consuming one more unit of a good
- When MPC=MSC and MPB=MSB, socially optimal equilibrium is achieved.
- ***WHEN*** $MPC=MSC=MPB=MSB$, ***allocative efficiency*** is achieved

##### Externalities
- Occur when the production or consumption of a good/service cause external costs and/or external benefits
	- *because* Side effects of economic activity to a third party or unintended consequence of economic activity
- Externalities cause market failure if the **price mechanism** does not take into account the **social costs** and benefits of production and consumption

#### The distinction between  positive and negative externalities
##### Negative Externalities
- Occurs when production and/or consumption creates an **external cost**
- Causes overconsumption/production - there's always more than what we want being produced
	- Market quantity is greater than optimal quantity
	- Market price is less than optimal price
- Results in *deadweight loss*
- Two types: a [[#Negative Production Externality]] and a [[#Negative Consumption Externality]]

###### Negative Production Externality
- Where the *marginal social cost* of production is higher than the *marginal private cost*
- Examples include
	- air
	- land
	- noise pollution

###### Negative Consumption Externality
- Where the *marginal social benefit* of consumption is lower than the *marginal private benefit*
- Examples include
	- Smoking
	- Smoking
	- Smoking
	- Alcoholism
	- Smoking
	- Alcoholism

##### Positive Externalities
- External benefits of consumption or production for third parties
	- Causes under consumption or under production
	- Results in a DWL

###### Positive Consumption Externality
- Where the *marginal social benefit* of consumption is higher than the *marginal private benefit*
- Examples include
	- Flu vaccines
	- Education

###### Positive Production Externality
- Where the *marginal social cost* of production is lower than the *marginal private cost*
- Examples include
	- Lower transport costs for local firms following construction of new roads

#### How an externality can influence market efficiency i.e. a deadweight loss


#### Policy options to correct for externalities, including the use of taxes and subsidies
- **Two** types
	- [[#Regulation/Legislation]] set by the government
	- [[#Market Based Approaches]] - taxes and subsidies

##### Regulation/Legislation
###### Negative Production Externality
- Regulations can forbid the dumping of pollutants to the environment
	- Limit the amount of pollutants using a maximum amount
	- Limit the quantity of output to producers
	- Require technologies (methods of production) to reduce emissions

###### Negative Consumption Externality
- Prevent consumer activities such as legal restrictions to smoking (public areas)
- Reduce demand towards $MSB$
	- Quantity lowered to $Q_o$ and price to $P_o$

###### Positive Production Externality
- Direct government provision;
	- coming out of government funds
- $MPC$ shifts towards $MSC$
- Quantity increases to $Q_o$ and price decreases to $P_o$

###### Positive Consumption Externality
- **Legislation**: used to increase consumption e.g. compulsory ages to education
- **Advertising**: used to increase consumption e.g. public advertisement for education
- Demand increases from MPB to MSB
- Quantity increases to $Q_o$ and price increases to $P_o$


##### Market Based Approaches
###### Negative Production Externality
- Imposing a tax on per unit of production or pollutant emission
- Internalise the external cost (recognition)

###### Negative Consumption Externality
- Impose indirect tax the size of the external cost
- The impact of the tax is passed onto consumers as a higher price they now have to burden
- Quantity drops to $Q_o$ and price increases to $P_c$

###### Positive Production Externality
- Government can provide subsidies the size of the external benefit   (internalise)
- MSC=MPC + subsidy
- Quantity increases to $Q_o$ and price falls to $P_o$

###### Positive Consumption Externality
- Direct Provision to increase consumption e.g. education and healthcare
- Supply increases the size of government provision
- Quantity falls to $Q_o$ and price to $P_c$
- **Subsidies**
	- Government can provide subsidies to producers to lower the cost and hence lower the price for consumers 
	- Subsidy used to internalize the external benefit
	- Quantity higher at Qo and price lower at pc


## Notes on Research
- make sure to not explain/define what the thingos are, mpc msc whatevs
- don't contradict yourself and make sure all information is correct
- like 15 references
- need gov regulation and tax, so both a market based approach and regulation/legislation

unit 1 and 2 datas and a unit 2 extended response
multiple choice is everything
