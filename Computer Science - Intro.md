###### Variables
- Are memory addresses in a computer used to store information so that the CPU may use it, for example, $i=0$
- **Constants** are variables that are immutable - they do not change. For example, $pi=3.14$

###### Pseudocode
- Make sure to include line numbers
- Used to plan out a program logically (in our mind), breaking down complex propgrams into step by step logical thingos for human readable
